{"type": "poem", "author": "Robert Frost", "text": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference."}
{"type": "poem", "author": "Emily Dickinson", "text": "Because I could not stop for Death—\nHe kindly stopped for me—\nThe Carriage held but just Ourselves—\nAnd Immortality.\n\nWe slowly drove—He knew no haste\nAnd I had put away\nMy labor and my leisure too,\nFor His Civility—\n\nWe passed the School, where Children strove\nAt Recess—in the Ring—\nWe passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—\nWe passed the Setting Sun—\n\nOr rather—He passed Us—\nThe Dews drew quivering and chill—\nFor only Gossamer, my Gown—\nMy Tippet—only Tulle—\n\nWe paused before a House that seemed\nA Swelling of the Ground—\nThe Roof was scarcely visible—\nThe Cornice—in the Ground—\n\nSince then—'tis Centuries—and yet\nFeels shorter than the Day\nI first surmised the Horses' Heads\nWere toward Eternity—"}
{"type": "poem", "author": "William Wordsworth", "text": "I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host, of golden daffodils;\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\nContinuous as the stars that shine\nAnd twinkle on the milky way,\nThey stretched in never-ending line\nAlong the margin of a bay:\nTen thousand saw I at a glance,\nTossing their heads in sprightly dance.\n\nThe waves beside them danced; but they\nOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:\nA poet could not but be gay,\nIn such a jocund company:\nI gazed—and gazed—but little thought\nWhat wealth the show to me had brought:\n\nFor oft, when on my couch I lie\nIn vacant or in pensive mood,\nThey flash upon that inward eye\nWhich is the bliss of solitude;\nAnd then my heart with pleasure fills,\nAnd dances with the daffodils."}
