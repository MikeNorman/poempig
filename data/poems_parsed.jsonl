{"type": "quote", "author": "David Whyte", "text": "DESPAIR\ntakes us in when we have nowhere else to go; when we feel the heart cannot break anymore, when our world or our loved ones disappear, when we feel we cannot be loved or do not deserve to be loved, when our God disappoints, or when our body is carrying profound pain in a way that does not seem to go away.\nDespair is a haven with its own temporary form of beauty and of self compassion, it is the invitation we accept when we want to remove ourselves from hurt. Despair, is a last protection. To disappear through despair, is to seek a temporary but necessary illusion, a place where we hope nothing can ever find us in the same way again.\nDespair is a necessary and seasonal state of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore. We give up hope when certain particular wishes are no longer able to come true and despair is the time in which we both endure and heal, even when we have not yet found the new form of hope.\nDespair is strangely, the last bastion of hope; the wish being, that if we cannot be found in the old way we cannot ever be touched or hurt in that way again. Despair is the sweet but illusory abstraction of leaving the body while still inhabiting it, so we can stop the body from feeling anymore. Despair is the place we go when we no longer want to make a home in the world and where we feel, with a beautifully cruel form of satisfaction, that we may never have deserved that home in the first place. Despair, strangely, has its own sense of achievement, and despair, even more strangely, needs despair to keep it alive.\nDespair turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season and start to shape our identity around its frozen disappointments. But despair can only stay beyond its appointed time through the forced artificiality of created distance, by abstracting ourselves from bodily feeling, by trapping ourselves in the disappointed mind, by convincing ourselves that the seasons have stopped and can never turn again, and perhaps, most simply and importantly, by refusing to let the body breathe by its self, fully and deeply. Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of time; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.\nTo keep despair alive we have to abstract and immobilize our bodies, our faculties of hearing, touch and smell, and keep the surrounding springtime of the world at a distance. Despair needs a certain tending, a reinforcing, and isolation, but the body left to itself will breathe, the ears will hear the first birdsong of morning or catch the leaves being touched by the wind in the trees, and the wind will blow away even the grayest cloud; will move even the most immovable season; the heart will continue to beat and the world, we realize, will never stop or go away.\nThe antidote to despair is not to be found in the brave attempt to cheer ourselves up with happy abstracts, but in paying a profound and courageous attention to the body and the breath, independent of our imprisoning thoughts and stories, even strangely, in paying attention to despair itself, and the way we hold it, and which we realize, was never ours to own and to hold in the first place. To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.\nWe take the first steps out of despair by taking on its full weight and coming fully to ground in our wish not to be here. We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again. In that place, strangely, despair cannot do anything but change into something else, into some other season, as it was meant to do, from the beginning. Despair is a difficult, beautiful necessary, a binding understanding between human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss, but it is a season, a wave form passing through the body, not a prison surrounding us. A season left to itself will always move, however slowly, under its own patience, power and volition.\nRefusing to despair about despair itself, we can let despair have its own natural life and take a first step onto the foundational ground of human compassion, the ability to see and understand and touch and even speak, the heartfelt grief of another."}

I was a wanderer\nwho feels the solace of his native land\nunder his feet again and moving in his blood.\nI went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped\nmy track was there to steady me. It was no abyss\nthat lay before me, but only the level ground.\n\nIII.\nSometimes our life reminds me\nof a forest in which there is a graceful clearing\nand in that opening a house,\nan orchard and garden,\ncomfortable shades, and flowers\nred and yellow in the sun, a pattern\nmade in the light for the light to return to.\nThe forest is mostly dark, its ways\nto be made anew day after day, the dark\nricher than the light and more blessed,\nprovided we stay brave\nenough to keep on going in.\n\nIV.\nHow many times have I come to you out of my head\nwith joy, if ever a man was,\nfor to approach you I have given up the light\nand all directions.

Like the water\nof a deep stream, love is always too much. We\ndid not make it. Though we drink till we burst\nwe cannot have it all, or want it all.\nIn its abundance it survives our thirst.\nIn the evening we come down to the shore\nto drink our fill, and sleep, while it\nflows through the regions of the dark.\nIt does not hold us, except we keep returning\nto its rich waters thirsty. We enter,\nwilling to die, into the commonwealth of its joy.\n\nVII.\nI give you what is unbounded, passing from dark to dark,\ncontaining darkness: a night of rain, an early morning.\nI give you the life I have let live for the love of you:\na clump of orange-blooming weeds beside the road,\nthe young orchard waiting in the snow, our own life\nthat we have planted in the ground, as I\nhave planted mine in you.

{"type": "poem", "author": "Eric Fromm", "text": "The first step to take is to become aware that love is an art, just as living is an art; if we want to learn how to love we must proceed in the same way we have to proceed if we want to learn any other art, say music, painting, carpentry, or the art of medicine or engineering. \nWhat are the necessary steps in learning any art? The process of learning an art can be divided conveniently into two parts: one, the mastery of the theory; the other, the mastery of the practice. If I want to learn the art of medicine, I must first know the facts about the human body, and about various diseases. When I have all this theoretical knowledge, I am by no means competent in the art of medicine. I shall become a master in this art only after a great deal of practice, until eventually the results of my theoretical knowledge and the results of my practice are blended into one — my intuition, the essence of the mastery of any art. But, aside from learning the theory and practice, there is a third factor necessary to becoming a master in any art — the mastery of the art must be a matter of ultimate concern; there must be nothing else in the world more important than the art. This holds true for music, for medicine, for carpentry — and for love. And, maybe, here lies the answer to the question of why people in our culture try so rarely to learn this art, in spite of their obvious failures: in spite of the deep-seated craving for love, almost everything else is considered to be more important than love: success, prestige, money, power — almost all our energy is used for the learning of how to achieve these aims, and almost none to learn the art of loving."}
{"type": "poem", "author": "Rilke", "text": "It is a question in marriage, to my feeling, not of creating a quick community of spirit by tearing down and destroying all boundaries, but rather a good marriage is that in which each appoints the other guardian of his solitude, and shows him this confidence, the greatest in his power to bestow. A togetherness between two people is an impossibility, and where it seems, nevertheless, to exist, it is a narrowing, a reciprocal agreement which robs either one party or both of his fullest freedom and development. But, once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole and against a wide sky!\nTherefore this too must be the standard for rejection or choice: whether one is willing to stand guard over the solitude of a person and whether one is inclined to set this same person at the gate of one’s own solitude, of which he learns only through that which steps, festively clothed, out of the great darkness.\nAll companionship can consist only in the strengthening of two neighboring solitudes, whereas everything that one is wont to call giving oneself is by nature harmful to companionship: for when a person abandons himself, he is no longer anything, and when two people both give themselves up in order to come close to each other, there is no longer any ground beneath them and their being together is a continual falling… Once there is disunity between them, the confusion grows with every day; neither of the two has anything unbroken, pure, and unspoiled about him any longer… They who wanted to do each other good are now handling one another in an imperious and intolerant manner, and in the struggle somehow to get out of their untenable and unbearable state of confusion, they commit the greatest fault that can happen to human relationships: they become impatient. They hurry to a conclusion; to come, as they believe, to a final decision, they try once and for all to establish their relationship, whose surprising changes have frightened them, in order to remain the same now and forever (as they say)."}

As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.\nSpeak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\nExercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.\nBe yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\nNurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.

In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.”"}

{"type": "poem", "author": "WALLACE STEVENS", "text": "The Idea of Order at Key West\n\nShe sang beyond the genius of the sea.   \nThe water never formed to mind or voice,   \nLike a body wholly body, fluttering\nIts empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion   \nMade constant cry, caused constantly a cry,   \nThat was not ours although we understood,   \nInhuman, of the veritable ocean.\n\nThe sea was not a mask. No more was she.   \nThe song and water were not medleyed sound   \nEven if what she sang was what she heard,   \nSince what she sang was uttered word by word.\nIt may be that in all her phrases stirred   \nThe grinding water and the gasping wind;   \nBut it was she and not the sea we heard.\n\nFor she was the maker of the song she sang.   \nThe ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea\nWas merely a place by which she walked to sing.   \nWhose spirit is this? we said, because we knew   \nIt was the spirit that we sought and knew   \nThat we should ask this often as she sang.\n\nIf it was only the dark voice of the sea   \nThat rose, or even colored by many waves;   \nIf it was only the outer voice of sky\nAnd cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,   \nHowever clear, it would have been deep air,   \nThe heaving speech of air, a summer sound   \nRepeated in a summer without end\nAnd sound alone. But it was more than that,   \nMore even than her voice, and ours, among\nThe meaningless plungings of water and the wind,   \nTheatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped   \nOn high horizons, mountainous atmospheres   \nOf sky and sea.\n\n                  It was her voice that made   \nThe sky acutest at its vanishing.   \nShe measured to the hour its solitude.   \nShe was the single artificer of the world\nIn which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,   \nWhatever self it had, became the self\nThat was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,   \nAs we beheld her striding there alone,\nKnew that there never was a world for her   \nExcept the one she sang and, singing, made.\n\nRamon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,   \nWhy, when the singing ended and we turned   \nToward the town, tell why the glassy lights,   \nThe lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,   \nAs the night descended, tilting in the air,   \nMastered the night and portioned out the sea,   \nFixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,   \nArranging, deepening, enchanting night.\n\nOh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,   \nThe maker’s rage to order words of the sea,   \nWords of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,   \nAnd of ourselves and of our origins,\nIn ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds."}

{"type": "quote", "author": "Kevin Kelly", "text": "• About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.\n• No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.\n• Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.\n• Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.\n• Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.\n• If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.\n• Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.\n• When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.\n• Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.\n• Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.\n• Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.\n• When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.\n• Criticize in private, praise in public.\n• Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.\n• It is the duty of a student to get everything out of a teacher, and the duty of a teacher to get everything out of a student.\n• If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.\n• Ask funders for money, and they’ll give you advice; but ask for advice and they’ll give you money.\n• Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.\n• Immediately pay what you owe to vendors, workers, contractors. They will go out of their way to work with you first next time.\n• The biggest lie we tell ourselves is “I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.”\n• Your growth as a conscious being is measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have.\n• Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.\n• Handy measure: the distance between your fingertips of your outstretched arms at shoulder level is your height.\n• The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.\n• Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us.\n• Never ask a woman if she is pregnant. Let her tell you if she is.\n• Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.\n• When public speaking, pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.\n• There is no such thing as being “on time.” You are either late or you are early. Your choice.\n• Ask anyone you admire: Their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone.\n• The best way to get a correct answer on the internet is to post an obviously wrong answer and wait for someone to correct you.\n• You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.\n• Spend as much time crafting the subject line of an email as the message itself because the subject line is often the only thing people read.\n• Don’t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.\n• When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.\n• Use a password manager: Safer, easier, better.\n• Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.\n• The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.\n• A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.\n• Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you’ll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.\n• Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks, even if you believe it is not deserved.\n• Always read the plaque next to the monument.\n• When you have some success, the feeling of being an imposter can be real. Who am I fooling? But when you create things that only you — with your unique talents and experience — can do, then you are absolutely not an imposter. You are the ordained. It is your duty to work on things that only you can do.\n• What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.\n• Make stuff that is good for people to have.\n• When you open paint, even a tiny bit, it will always find its way to your clothes no matter how careful you are. Dress accordingly.\n• To keep young kids behaving on a car road trip, have a bag of their favorite candy and throw a piece out the window each time they misbehave.\n• You cannot get smart people to work extremely hard just for money.\n• When you don’t know how much to pay someone for a particular task, ask them “what would be fair” and their answer usually is.\n• 90% of everything is crap. If you think you don’t like opera, romance novels, TikTok, country music, vegan food, NFTs, keep trying to see if you can find the 10% that is not crap.\n• You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.\n• We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. Miraculous things can be accomplished if you give it ten years. A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.\n• Thank a teacher who changed your life.\n• You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.\n• Your best job will be one that you were unqualified for because it stretches you. In fact only apply to jobs you are unqualified for.\n• Buy used books. They have the same words as the new ones. Also libraries.\n• You can be whatever you want, so be the person who ends meetings early.\n• A wise man said, “Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates. At the first gate, ask yourself, “Is it true?” At the second gate ask, “Is it necessary?” At the third gate ask, “Is it kind?”\n• Take the stairs.\n• What you actually pay for something is at least twice the listed price because of the energy, time, money needed to set it up, learn, maintain, repair, and dispose of at the end. Not all prices appear on labels. Actual costs are 2x listed prices.\n• When you arrive at your room in a hotel, locate the emergency exits. It only takes a minute.\n• The only productive way to answer “what should I do now?” is to first tackle the question of “who should I become?”\n• Average returns sustained over an above-average period of time yield extraordinary results. Buy and hold.\n• It’s thrilling to be extremely polite to rude strangers.\n• It’s possible that a not-so smart person, who can communicate well, can do much better than a super smart person who can’t communicate well. That is good news because it is much easier to improve your communication skills than your intelligence.\n• Getting cheated occasionally is the small price for trusting the best of everyone, because when you trust the best in others, they generally treat you best.\n• Art is whatever you can get away with.\n• For the best results with your children, spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.\n• Purchase the most recent tourist guidebook to your home town or region. You’ll learn a lot by playing the tourist once a year.\n• Dont wait in line to eat something famous. It is rarely worth the wait.\n• To rapidly reveal the true character of a person you just met, move them onto an abysmally slow internet connection. Observe.\n• Prescription for popular success: do something strange. Make a habit of your weird.\n• Be a pro. Back up your back up. Have at least one physical backup and one backup in the cloud. Have more than one of each. How much would you pay to retrieve all your data, photos, notes, if you lost them? Backups are cheap compared to regrets.\n• Dont believe everything you think you believe.\n• To signal an emergency, use the rule of three; 3 shouts, 3 horn blasts, or 3 whistles.\n• At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3.\n• Actual great opportunities do not have “Great Opportunities” in the subject line.\n• When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other.\n• Take note if you find yourself wondering “Where is my good knife? Or, where is my good pen?” That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.\n• When you are stuck, explain your problem to others. Often simply laying out a problem will present a solution. Make “explaining the problem” part of your troubleshooting process.\n• When buying a garden hose, an extension cord, or a ladder, get one substantially longer than you think you need. It’ll be the right size.\n• Dont bother fighting the old; just build the new.\n• Your group can achieve great things way beyond your means simply by showing people that they are appreciated.\n• When someone tells you about the peak year of human history, the period of time when things were good before things went downhill, it will always be the years of when they were 10 years old — which is the peak of any human’s existence.\n• You are as big as the things that make you angry.\n• When speaking to an audience it’s better to fix your gaze on a few people than to “spray” your gaze across the room. Your eyes telegraph to others whether you really believe what you are saying.\n• Habit is far more dependable than inspiration. Make progress by making habits. Dont focus on getting into shape. Focus on becoming the kind of person who never misses a workout.\n• When negotiating, dont aim for a bigger piece of the pie; aim to create a bigger pie.\n• If you repeated what you did today 365 more times will you be where you want to be next year?\n• You see only 2% of another person, and they see only 2% of you. Attune yourselves to the hidden 98%.\n• Your time and space are limited. Remove, give away, throw out things in your life that dont spark joy any longer in order to make room for those that do.\n• Our descendants will achieve things that will amaze us, yet a portion of what they will create could have been made with today’s materials and tools if we had had the imagination. Think bigger.\n• For a great payoff be especially curious about the things you are not interested in.\n• Focus on directions rather than destinations. Who knows their destiny? But maintain the right direction and you’ll arrive at where you want to go.\n• Every breakthrough is at first laughable and ridiculous. In fact if it did not start out laughable and ridiculous, it is not a breakthrough.\n• If you loan someone $20 and you never see them again because they are avoiding paying you back, that makes it worth $20.\n• Copying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end.\n• The best time to negotiate your salary for a new job is the moment AFTER they say they want you, and not before. Then it becomes a game of chicken for each side to name an amount first, but it is to your advantage to get them to give a number before you do.\n• Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them.\n• Dont purchase extra insurance if you are renting a car with a credit card.\n• If your opinions on one subject can be predicted from your opinions on another, you may be in the grip of an ideology. When you truly think for yourself your conclusions will not be predictable.\n• Aim to die broke. Give to your beneficiaries before you die; it’s more fun and useful. Spend it all. Your last check should go to the funeral home and it should bounce.\n• The chief prevention against getting old is to remain astonished."}

{"type": "poem", "author": "Steinbeck", "text": "Dear Thom:\nWe had your letter this morning. I will answer it from my point of view and of course Elaine will from hers.\nFirst — if you are in love — that’s a good thing — that’s about the best thing that can happen to anyone. Don’t let anyone make it small or light to you.\nSecond — There are several kinds of love. One is a selfish, mean, grasping, egotistical thing which uses love for self-importance. This is the ugly and crippling kind. The other is an outpouring of everything good in you — of kindness and consideration and respect — not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable. The first kind can make you sick and small and weak but the second can release in you strength, and courage and goodness and even wisdom you didn’t know you had.\nYou say this is not puppy love. If you feel so deeply — of course it isn’t puppy love.\nBut I don’t think you were asking me what you feel. You know better than anyone. What you wanted me to help you with is what to do about it — and that I can tell you.\nGlory in it for one thing and be very glad and grateful for it.\nThe object of love is the best and most beautiful. Try to live up to it.\nIf you love someone — there is no possible harm in saying so — only you must remember that some people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that shyness into consideration.\nGirls have a way of knowing or feeling what you feel, but they usually like to hear it also.\nIt sometimes happens that what you feel is not returned for one reason or another — but that does not make your feeling less valuable and good.\nLastly, I know your feeling because I have it and I’m glad you have it.\nWe will be glad to meet Susan. She will be very welcome. But Elaine will make all such arrangements because that is her province and she will be very glad to.

Moreover, I am acquainted with your heart and know that few are better, but you are nevertheless irritating and unbearable, and I consider it most difficult to live with you.\n\n'All of your good qualities become obscured by your super-cleverness and are made useless to the world merely because of your rage at wanting to know everything better than others; of wanting to improve and master what you cannot command. With this you embitter the people around you, since no one wants to be improved or enlightened in such a forceful way, least of all by such an insignificant individual as you still are; no one can tolerate being reproved by you, who also still show so many weaknesses yourself, least of all in your adverse manner, which in oracular tones, proclaims this is so and so, without ever supposing an objection.\n\n'If you were less like you, you would only be ridiculous, but thus as you are, you are highly annoying.'"}

The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power, but it ended up being cast as a struggle to preserve the souls of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome. It's easier to get people to fight for an idea. And whichever side wins, their ideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if God wanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.\n\nWe often like to think of World War II as a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism. We conveniently forget that the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.\n\nI'm not saying that struggles are never about ideas, just that they will always be made to seem to be about ideas, whether they are or not. And just as there is nothing so unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion, there is nothing so wrong as the principles of the most recently defeated opponent.

{"type": "quote", "author": "Unknown", "text": "The family history of Lord Soma is recorded in a scroll called the Chiken Marokashi. It was an unequaled family genealogy in Japan. The lord’s mansion suddenly caught fire one year. Lord Soma lamented: “I do not bemoan the loss of the manor and its fittings. They can all be replaced if they are destroyed in the fire. Regrettably, though, I couldn’t retrieve our treasured heirloom, the family tree.” One of his attendants declared: “I shall enter the flames and save this treasure.” Lord Soma and the other retainers chortled incredulously, “How can you salvage it now when the building is engulfed by this fire?” The retainer was never effusive in service, nor had he ever been exceptionally useful, but for some reason his lord was fond of him as he was diligent. “By no means have I been an effective servant to His Lordship because of my clumsiness. Nevertheless, I have always been ready to sacrifice my life for something useful should the opportunity arise. I believe that time is now.” With that, he stormed into the blazing inferno. As soon as the fire had been put out, Lord Soma instructed his men, “Find his body. It is such a shame!” They searched through the burnt ruins and finally located his charred remains in the garden area next to the residence. Blood gushed from his stomach as they turned his prostrated body over. Evidently he had slit open his belly and inserted the document inside, protecting it from the flames. Henceforth, it became known as the Chi-keizu or “Blood Genealogy.”"}

{"type": "poem", "author": "Abraham lincoln", "text": "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.\nwhenever the vicious portion of [our] population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision stores, throw printing-presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend upon it, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will be left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual.\nIt is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us. And when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them. The question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot. Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And when such an one does, it will require the people to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent, to successfully frustrate his designs. Distinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down."}

The temptation to do this is often born of an understanding that others will disapprove of our behavior. Often, there are good reasons why they would.\n\nLying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It condenses a lack of trust and trustworthiness into a single act. It is both a failure of understanding and an unwillingness to be understood. To lie is to recoil from relationship."}

Friendship not only helps us see ourselves through another’s eyes, but can be sustained over the years only with someone who has repeatedly forgiven us for our trespasses as we must find it in ourselves to forgive them in turn. A friend knows our difficulties and shadows and remains in sight, a companion to our vulnerabilities more than our triumphs, when we are under the strange illusion we do not need them. An undercurrent of real friendship is a blessing exactly because its elemental form is rediscovered again and again through understanding and mercy. All friendships of any length are based on a continued, mutual forgiveness. Without tolerance and mercy all friendships die."}

{"type": "quote", "author": "David Whyte", "text": "Love may be sanctified and ennobled by its commitment to the unconditional horizon of perfection, but what makes love real in the human world seems to be our moving, struggling conversation with that wanted horizon rather than any possibility of arrival. The hope for, or the declaration of a purely spiritual, unconditional love is more often a coded desire for immunity and safety, an attempt to forgo the trials of vulnerability, powerlessness and the exquisite pain to which we apprentice ourselves in a relationship, a marriage, in raising children, in a work we love and desire.\n\nThe hope for unconditional love is the hope for a different life than the one we have been given. Love is the conversation between possible, searing disappointment and a profoundly imagined sense of arrival and fulfillment; how we shape that conversation is the touchstone of our ability to love in the real inhabited world. The true signature and perhaps even the miracle of human love is helplessness, and all the more miraculous because it is a helplessness which we wittingly or unwittingly choose; in our love of a child, a partner, a work, or a road we have to take against the odds."}

I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness, with which one chemical atom meets another. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, but diadems and authority, only to the highest rank, that being permitted to speak truth as having none above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone is sincere.

{"type": "quote", "author": "Elizabeth Gilbert", "text": "I AM WILLING\nDear Ones:\nSix months ago this week, Rayya died.\nPeople keep asking me how I’m doing, and I’m not always sure how to answer that. It depends on the day. It depends on the minute. Right this moment, I’m OK. Yesterday, not so good. Tomorrow, we’ll see.\nHere is what I have learned about Grief, though.\nI have learned that Grief is a force of energy that cannot be controlled or predicted. It comes and goes on its own schedule. Grief does not obey your plans, or your wishes. Grief will do whatever it wants to you, whenever it wants to. In that regard, Grief has a lot in common with Love.\nThe only way that I can “handle” Grief, then, is the same way that I “handle” Love — by not “handling” it. By bowing down before its power, in complete humility.\nWhen Grief comes to visit me, it’s like being visited by a tsunami. I am given just enough warning to say, “Oh my god, this is happening RIGHT NOW,” and then I drop to the floor on my knees and let it rock me. It’s a full-body experience. To resist it is to be brutalized by it. You just bow down — that’s all you CAN do — and you let this thing roll through your heart and body and mind, in all its vehemence.\nHow do you survive the tsunami of Grief?\nBy being willing to experience it, without resistance. By being willing to feel everything. By being willing to accept the unacceptable.\nThe conversation of Grief, then, is one of prayer-and-response.\nGrief says to me: “You will never love anyone the way you loved Rayya.”\nAnd I reply: “I am willing for that to be true.”\nGrief says: “She’s gone, and she’s never coming back.”\nI reply: “I am willing for that to be true.”\nGrief says: “You will never see her walk in the door again.”\nI say: “I am willing.”\nGrief says: “You will never have access to her wisdom again.”\nI say: “I am willing.”\nGrief says: “You will never hear that laugh again.”\nI say: “I am willing.”\nGrief says, “You will never smell her skin again.”\nI get down on the floor on my fucking knees, and — and through my sheets of tears — I say, “I AM WILLING.”\nI am beginning to understand that Grief is not the same thing as Depression. Depression is unwilling. Grief is a MOVEMENT — catastrophic and mighty — that you ALLOW to rock you and spin you. Depression is refusal to feel. Depression is a refusal to move, or to be moved. Depression is resistance, and resistance is futile.\nI am not depressed, in the wake of Rayya’s death. I am DESTROYED, but I am not depressed — but that’s only because I am willing to be destroyed.\nI will live on, because I am WILLING. I am willing to take this life on God’s terms, not mine.\nLove’s terms, not mine.\nGrief’s terms, not mine.\nI am willing to surrender to the reality that I will never understand any of this. I am even willing to accept that I may not ever fully heal from the loss of Rayya.\nGrief says: “You may never recover from this”\nAnd I say: “I am willing.”\nThis is the job of the living — to be willing to bow down before EVERYTHING that is bigger than you. And nearly everything in this world is bigger than you. Let your willingness be the only big thing about you.\nMy friend Martha Beck officiated the commitment ceremony last year for me and Rayya. I will never forget what she said on that day: “True love always liberates the beloved.”\nSix months ago, I had to let Rayya go. It wasn’t up to me. It was brutal, and I was willing. I bowed down and wept. God’s will, not mine. But Rayya belonged to God before she belonged to me. She NEVER belonged to me, actually; I just loved her. And true love always liberates the beloved.\nI am willing.\nTwo days ago — on the six month anniversary of Rayya’s death — Martha wrote me a letter. She said, “The spark of absolutely unique, inimitable energy that showed up as Rayya is no longer in form. I can’t wrap my head around it. What is she doing now? What is she BEING now? Death is every bit as common as life, and both utterly baffle me.”\nMe, too. I am completely fucking baffled. I don’t understand Life any more than I understand Love or Death or Grief.\nBut I am willing to be here for the duration of the mystery. I am willing to be rocked by every last tsunami.\nI don’t know what Rayya is doing or being now. That is not for me to know. I only know that I will love her forever. And I know what I am doing and what I am being:\nI am willing.\nOnward,\n\nElizabeth Gilbert"}

Lies are usually attempts to make everything simpler — for the liar — than it really is, or ought to be.\n\nIn lying to others we end up lying to ourselves. We deny the importance of an event, or a person, and thus deprive ourselves of a part of our lives. Or we use one piece of the past or present to screen out another. Thus we lose faith even within our own lives.\n\nThe unconscious wants truth, as the body does. The complexity and fecundity of dreams come from the complexity and fecundity of the unconscious struggling to fulfill that desire.\n\nThe possibilities that exist between two people, or among a group of people, are a kind of alchemy. They are the most interesting thing in life. The liar is someone who keeps losing sight of these possibilities.\n\nWhen relationships are determined by manipulation, by the need for control, they may possess a dreary, bickering kind of drama, but they cease to be interesting.

{"type": "quote", "author": "Osho", "text": "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed....\nYou are the kingdom of heaven, you are like a mustard seed. Be ready to die, prepare for your death! Of course there will be trembling and fear and apprehension. The jump is going to be difficult. Many times you may come back, many times you will go to the very brink and turn back and escape, because there is an abyss. The seed can only know the abyss, the seed cannot know the tree. There is no way that the seed can witness the sprouting tree -- there is no way. The seed has to die and trust in the unknown -- that it will happen.\n\nIf you are ready to die, it happens. Go and sow seeds in the ground: when the tree has come, then dig the ground again and see where the seed is. It will have disappeared, it will not be there. Go and dig in a Buddha, in a Jesus -- you will not find the man, the seed. This is the meaning of Jesus being the son of God, no more the son of Joseph the carpenter -- because the seed came from Joseph the carpenter and Mary, but now the seed has disappeared, the shell has disappeared. This tree never came from the visible, it is from the invisible.\n\nLook at Jesus: the seed is no longer there, only God is there. Be ready to die so that you can be reborn. Drop the mind, the body, the ego, the identity. Suddenly you will find that something new is growing within you: you have become a womb, you are pregnant. And to be spiritually pregnant is the peak of creation, because you are creating yourself through it. Nothing is comparable to it. You may create a great painting or a great sculpture, but nothing is to be compared with when you create yourself, when you \"self-create\" yourself."}

Then even if I answer, the answer will never reach you. You are not empty enough to receive the answer. The answer is already there: you are prejudiced, poisoned already.\nThere are two types of questioning: one is out of knowledge, and then it is useless because then only a debate is possible, not a dialogue. But when you ask out of ignorance, knowing well that you don't know, when you know that you don't know, and ask, you have become a disciple. Now it is not going to be an argument.

You cannot use your mind with the new’ with the old, the mind is skillful. The mind can function only with the old’ with the new, the mind is utterly useless.\nHence, fear arises, and leaving the old, comfortable, safe world, the world of convenience, pain arises. It is the same pain that the child feels when he comes out of the womb of the mother. It is the same pain that the bird feels when he comes out of the egg. It is the same pain that the bird will feel when he will try for the first time to be on the wing.\nIt is because of the pain of love, millions of people live a loveless life. They too suffer, and their suffering is futile. To suffer in love is not to suffer in vain. To suffer in love is creative’ it takes you to higher levels of consciousness. To suffer without love is utterly a waste’ it leads you nowhere, it keeps you moving in the same vicious circle."}
