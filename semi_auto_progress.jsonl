Hisdinner dishes were undone, his breakfast dishes were undone, he needed a shave, and ashfrom his rolled cigarettes dropped onto his undershirt. Some of the ash was still burning.Sometimes the burning ash missed the undershirt and hit his skin, then he cursed, brushingit away. There was a knock on the trailer door. He got slowly to his feet and answered thedoor. It was Constance. She had a fifth of unopened whiskey in a bag.\"George, I left that son of a bitch, I couldn't stand that son of a bitchanymore.\"\"Sit down.\"George opened the fifth, got two glasses, filled each a third with whiskey, two thirdswith water. He sat down on the bed with Constance. She took a cigarette out of her purseand lit it. She was drunk and her hands trembled.\"I took his damn money too. I took his damn money and split while he was at work.You don't know how I've suffered with that son of a bitch.\" \"Lemme have a smoke,\" said George. She handed it to him and as she leaned near,George put his arm around her, pulled her over and kissed her.\"You son of a bitch,\" she said, \"I missed you.\"\"I miss those good legs of yours , Connie. I've really missed those goodlegs.\"\"You still like 'em?\"\"I get hot just looking.\"\"I could never make it with a college guy,\" said Connie. \"They're toosoft, they're milk toast. And he kept his house clean. George , it was like having a maid.He did it all. The place was spotless. You could eat beef stew right off the crapper. Hewas antiseptic, that's what he was.\"\"Drink up, you'll feel better.\"\"And he couldn't make love.\"\"You mean he couldn't get it up?\"\"Oh he got it up, he got it up all the time. But he didn't know how to make awoman happy, you know. He didn't know what to do. All that money, all that education, hewas useless.\"\"I wish I had a college education.\"\"You don't need one. You have everything you need, George.\"\"I'm just a flunky. All the shit jobs.\"\"I said you have everything you need, George. You know how to make a womanhappy.\"\"Yeh?\"\"Yes. And you know what else? His mother came around! His mother! Two or threetimes a week. And she'd sit there looking at me, pretending to like me but all the timeshe was treating me like I was a whore. Like I was a big bad whore stealing her son awayfrom her! Her precious Wallace! Christ! What a mess!\" \"He claimed he loved me.And I'd say, 'Look at my pussy, Walter!' And he wouldn't look at my pussy. He said, 'Idon't want to look at that thing.' That thing! That's what he called it! You're not afraidof my pussy, are you, George?\"\"It's never bit me yet.\" \"But you've bit it, you've nibbled it, haven'tyou George?\"\"I suppose I have.\"\"And you've licked it , sucked it?\"\"I suppose so.\"\"You know damn well, George, what you've done.\"\"How much money did you get?\"\"Six hundred dollars.\"\"I don't like people who rob other people, Connie.\"\"That's why you're a fucking dishwasher. You're honest. But he's such an ass,George. And he can afford the money, and I've earned it\u2026 him and his mother and hislove, his mother-love, his clean l;little wash bowls and toilets and disposal bags andbreath chasers and after shave lotions and his little hard-ons and his preciouslovemaking. All for himself, you understand, all for himself! You know what a womanwants, George.\"\"Thanks for the whiskey, Connie. Lemme have another cigarette.\"George filled them up again. \"I missed your legs, Connie. I've really missed thoselegs. I like the way you wear those high heels. They drive me crazy. These modern womendon't know what they're missing. The high heel shapes the calf, the thigh, the ass; itputs rhythm into the walk. It really turns me on!\"\"You talk like a poet, George. Sometimes you talk like that. You are one hell of adishwasher.\"\"You know what I'd really like to do?\"\"What?\"\"I'd like to whip you with my belt on the legs, the ass, the thighs. I'd like tomake you quiver and cry and then when you're quivering and crying I'd slam it into youpure love.\"\"I don't want that, George. You've never talked like that to me before. You'vealways done right with me.\"\"Pull your dress up higher.\"\"What?\"\"Pull your dress up higher, I want to see more of your legs.\"\"You like my legs, don't you, George?\"\"Let the light shine on them!\"Constance hiked her dress.\"God Christ shit,\" said George.\"You like my legs?\"\"I love your legs!\" Then George reached across the bed and slapped Constancehard across the face. Her cigarette flipped out of her mouth.\"what'd you do that for?\"\"You fucked Walter! You fucked Walter!\"\"So what the hell?\"\"So pull your dress up higher!\"\"No!\"\"Do what I say!\" George slapped again, harder. Constance hiked her skirt.\"Just up to the panties!\" shouted George. \"I don't quite want to see thepanties!\"\"Christ, George, what's gone wrong with you?\"\"You fucked Walter!\"\"George, I swear, you've gone crazy. I want to leave. Let me out of here,George!\"\"Don't move or I'll kill you!\"\"You'd kill me?\"\"I swear it!\" George got up and poured himself a shot of straight whiskey,drank it, and sat down next to Constance. He took the cigarette and held it against herwrist. She screamed. HE held it there, firmly, then pulled it away.\"I'm a man , baby, understand that?\"\"I know you're a man , George.\"\"Here, look at my muscles!\" George sat up and flexed both of his arms.\"Beautiful, eh ,baby? Look at that muscle! Feel it! Feel it!\"Constance felt one of the arms, then the other.\"Yes, you have a beautiful body, George.\"\"I'm a man. I'm a dishwasher but I'm a man, a real man.\"\"I know it, George.\" \"I'm not the milk shit you left.\"\"I know it.\"\"And I can sing, too. You ought to hear my voice.\"Constance sat there. George began to sing. He sang \"Old man River.\" Then hesang \"Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.\" He sang \"The St. LouisBlues.\" He Sang \"God Bless America,\" stopping several times and laughing.Then he sat down next to Constance. He said, \"Connie, you have beautiful legs.\"He asked for another cigarette. He smoked it, drank two more drinks, then put his headdown on Connie's legs, against the stockings, in her lap, and he said, \"Connie, Iguess I'm no good, I guess I'm crazy, I'm sorry I hit you, I'm sorry I burned you withthat cigarette.\"Constance sat there. She ran her fingers through George's hair, stroking him, soothinghim. Soon he was asleep. She waited a while longer. Then she lifted his head and placed iton the pillow, lifted his legs and straightened them out on the bed. She stood up, walkedto the fifth, poured a jolt of good whiskey in to her glass, added a touch of water anddrank it sown. She walked to the trailer door, pulled it open, stepped out, closed it. Shewalked through the backyard, opened the fence gate, walked up the alley under the oneo'clock moon. The sky was clear of clouds. The same sky full of clouds was up there. She gotout on the boulevard and walked east and reached the entrance of The Blue Mirror. Shewalked in, and there was Walter sitting alone and drunk at the end of the bar. She walkedup and sat down next to him. \"Missed me, baby?\" she asked. Walter looked up. Herecognized her. He didn't answer. He looked at the bartender and the bartender walkedtoward them They all knew each other.\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):The poem \"A Man\" by Charles Bukowski presents a raw and intimate encounter between a man and a woman named Constance. The setting is a squalid trailer, where George, the protagonist, is living a life of poverty and self-neglect. The arrival of Constance, who has left her abusive husband and stolen his money, brings a sense of excitement and chaos into George's life.The poem is notable for its stark and realistic portrayal of life at the margins of society. Bukowski's language is blunt and unadorned, reflecting the characters' own rough existence. The dialogue between George and Constance is full of profanity and sexual innuendo, capturing the raw and impulsive nature of their relationship.The poem also explores themes of masculinity, power, and desire. George's initial passivity and self-hatred give way to a sense of lust and control when he sees Constance's legs. Constance, on the other hand, is both vulnerable and defiant, expressing both her desire for George's physicality and her frustration with the constraints placed on women in society.Compared to Bukowski's other works, \"A Man\" is relatively short and straightforward. However, it shares many of the same themes and stylistic elements as his other poems, including the exploration of social outcasts, the rejection of societal norms, and the celebration of the raw and uncompromising aspects of human nature.In the context of its time period, the poem reflects the growing social unrest and disillusionment of the 1960s and 1970s. Bukowski's gritty and anti-establishment writing style resonated with countercultural movements of the time, which rejected traditional values and embraced a more authentic and rebellious way of life.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (13)5Great postWell writtenFantasticLike (13)Likes:Sky Spirals,Domhnaill,Reed Rosson,Emma286,Rucha Dalvi,i'm your huckleberry,Terwilliger Time,Grace Wilson,Rustedmetal,Blessedbeauty,priyanshrajmahendra,Ruthyvbz,Gerta233,pastpaytonTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsGerta233- Niceon Jan 30 2025 11:27 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserDomhnaill- hilariouson Sep 24 2022 07:16 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserPriyanshrajmahendra- Can someone tell me the meaning of last line \"They all knew each other.\" ?on Feb 15 2022 05:13 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserEmma286- My current ability to know how best to interpret most poems I read isn't good. So I'm left with (unfortunately) having to respond to this with that less than good best.

It suggests that true creation stems from an inner drive that transcends external obstacles and material possessions.The poem's brevity and straightforward language underscore its central message: that neither ideal surroundings nor freedom from obligations can guarantee artistic output. Instead, the speaker asserts that creativity persists amidst adversity, disability, and chaos.Bukowski's perspective aligns with his other works, which often explore themes of alienation and the struggle for authenticity in a superficial world. It also reflects the social and economic realities of his time, where many aspiring artists faced financial and logistical challenges. By challenging the notion that external factors determine artistic success, the poem encourages a deeper understanding of the complexities of the creative process.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (38)5InspiredGood workGood postLike (38)Tip:  Does it create a picture in your mind?Learn commentingLikes: ,Sky Spirals,Bee.,Out-lier,Tmishael,Zoe McMillan,Terwilliger Time,SculptorPoet,Charlie6,Alex Magrath,Luciano di Visco,Bluebird74,Saba1,Nick Pierce, , ,Rebeca2,Einar,J.

It employs a refrain of \"the impossibility of being human,\" emphasizing the unattainable nature of a perfect or fulfilling existence. Bukowski's language is raw and unflinching, mirroring the pain and chaos of the subjects' lives. Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem exhibits a wider historical scope and a focus on literary figures. It reflects the post-World War II era's disillusionment and exploration of existential themes, aligning with the modernist movement in its fragmented structure and rejection of traditional poetic conventions.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (124)59FantasticEnjoyableWell writtenLike (124)Likes:Kimberly Cassels,Petergarnett58, ,Zion monday,Juneedvenson,Richom,Yonathan Asefaw,Poet Kiptoo,Jason3,Un.expect.ed,octoberseventh, ,OneHazard,Ashleighonly,ParisBlue,deadmeatmobile,Solsticegreen51,broski,Irish Rose,Cubed Thoughts, ,Terwilliger Time,Summerling,Jared W,Powerblue62,IsabellaRose1820,Saplingpower87,FatMaestro,Lady-Pumblechook,Alek the Poet,Byrn Brynhild-Rus,Ahmed Jouini,Anno Domini,witchofarea51,Dani Printz,Michael Gentile,Aleks0.0, ,Samson Shillitoe,Benathor,megziepoo2U85,Alex Magrath,Hefe,Luciano di Visco,Irregardless,LoriCrockett32,ZTR,Civil War Camel, ,Einar,Burges,Jsaojose8,Jules656,Angelique Narag,Layne Green,InConquest,Faith Tysinger,Skyabove, ,Such-a-dork,AfkPoppinTabs,whypyongyang,Arturo Ruiz Iii,M.

Whether he was drunk or being lazy, it does not lessen the power of this poem and the talent of the writer. For those below who apparently did not understand, in poetry you dont have to follow the rules, and therein lies the beauty of it. His words are tragic and bitter truth. The impossiblities of being human is that nothing is impossible or shocking anymore. We are defined by superior intelligence and articulate speech and standing erect. But do we not first learn to crawl? When we lose the superior intelligence and articulate speech we begin to be just like the other animals. The very definition of human being is \"a person, esp. as distinguished from other animals or as representing the human species.\" This states that we, too, are animals. And it is in our human nature to act like animals at times, to kill is not beyond us, though we should know better, unless in self defense, but in self defense that means that someone was trying to kill us. So what really seperates us from the animals? When some animals are more honorable and courageous and loyal and kind and loving than many human beings. and more intelligent. Being human is an impossiblity. We are all animals.on Sep 05 2013 10:27 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Linda Marshall- I find it impossible NOT to dislike this piece.

Covert Payton- You are possibly the most arrogant, self-congratulatory purveyor of ridiculosity that I have *ever* encountered on this site. The number of hypocrisies and self-negating statements in these comments about this poem are virtually innumerable. And that fact that you insinuate that Allen Ginsberg is not a great poet is irredeemable.You can hate Bukowski all you want; you're a woman, so you're going to hate some of what he says right off the bat (most of those things I hate myself, re: his poetry). But to say that \"it's not poetry\" AND that \"it's no good\" (& especially what you seem to say, \"the main reason it's no good is because it's not poetry\") shows such a fundamental lack of understanding of what poetry is that I'm amazed that you can even write about it at all. \"Poetry is poetry because it's written in verse\" is a meaningless statement . . . you know why? Because the word \"verse\" actually means \"line\" -- a \"verse\" is a *part* of a poem -- technically it's a single LINE of a poem -- and YES there are \"formal\" verse patterns, but there is also a thing (an invention of those \"modernists\" that you laud so highly) called \"free verse\" in which the METER (which is really what you are TRYING to talk about, as the \"essential\" item of a \"poem\") is broken up amongst the lines, and in fact a \"formal\" meter is NOT required.And if you think Bukowski didn't \"learn his craft\" and \"work at it\" then that's just further evidence of your elitism and fundamental lack of understanding of how poetry *really* works, and what it *truly* is.Name-dropping all the great poets you've read? Check. Throwing out literary terms and definitions in a way that shows that you don't truly understand them? Check. Saying that Bukowski's poetry is like a \"laundry list\" and that he's \"masturbating\" onto the page and that he's only writing about himself and that his ego is running rampant? Check, check, check, check.I'm checking off the items on a list: it's a list of people that Bukowski was most determinedly NOT WRITING FOR . . . because they are a group of people with a hollow understanding of the root of language itself, and a group who designates a hallowed ground that can only be occupied by those who play by their rules. And when you say \"In your world, anything goes ... To me that's the definition of fascism and I hate and despise it\" it shows two things: 1) You have NO IDEA what fascism is, as a philosophy or as a politic; and 2) YOU are actually much, much closer to being a Fascist than Bukowski, or any of these other posters . . . \"anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear can see this at once\"on Nov 11 2020 05:38 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Linda Marshall- You are entitled to like Bukowski; I find it sad that you can't just accept that people don't share your hero-worship and look on him as a talentless poseur.And I haven't attacked you so why you feel that you are entitled to launch a personal attack on me is a mystery.Perhaps you are like those cultists who cannot bear to see their idols dissed in any way.I'm not going to get into any issue of 'qualifications;' I leave that to elitist snobs.And as someone who had family members murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis and for whom racism is an everyday reality I find your suggestion that I have no\u00a0 idea what fascism is both sad and laughable.And all Bukowski does is masturbate his senile ego on the page because he is too lazy, too arrogant and too narcissistic to bother to learn his craft.This particular poem IS like a laundry list and he IS an egotistical self-adorer.You can choose to worship him if you want but the clear 'message' of your words are: a) I'm a woman so I don't know what I'm talking about; b) I don;t like Bukowski so I must be stupid; c) I dare to criticise him so I must be arrogant even to DARE to say anything BAD about your Deity.It's a clear attempt to intimidate me and it won't work and I'm seriously considering whether or not to take the matter up with the mods of this forum.As it happens I am the co-ordinator of the Old Poetry Research Team and I routinely add poems, translations, authors and comments on the work of HUNDREDS of poets.I've got a BA Honours in English and History and I can speak and translate from six languages.So just because I'm a woman and a gypsy doesn't make me stupid or unqualified to express my opinion, mush!on Nov 12 2020 07:50 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192M.

You have a \"BA in Honors English\" well great! Does that mean that the PhDs and MFAs who are teaching Bukowski's poetry as an expemplification of either late Modernism or early Postmodernism, and pointing out his use of rhyme (internal and final), meter, and lyricism, don't know what they're talking about? That you know more then they do?Once again, it's your arrogance and condescion that rubs me the wrong way. If you could just take the time and energy to *really* look at ANY poetry, then you should be able to come out and say \"Well, *I* don't like it, because to ME it feels like he's not honed his craft & he's masturbating his senile ego onto the page\" then I never would have commented.

I am reading a lot of his work right now, and the man is brilliant. He doesnt hold anything back, he tells it like it is. and he doesn't care who's feelings he hurts. He is very descriptive and really puts an image in your head. This is just one of his poems, and I liked it. I got a message from it, and I dont care what form it is in. Poetry is poetry because it allows us to write what we feel, whether in free verse or a set form. Poetry is not meant to be criticized because sometimes only the author really knows the meaning of any of it. It is meant to inspire and to be an outlet for our feelings and thoughts when we dont know how else better to say or describe them. I dont get into the technical with poetry, modern, traditional. It doesn't matter to me, as long as the author is happy with it and accomplished what he wrote it for. If I don't like something or disagree with something I may comment on it, but I won't bash anyone's work simply because I dont like it or understand. It may not relate to you, but it relates to others, and if it reaches just one person and makes them think then the goal has been reached.on Sep 06 2013 07:35 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Linda Marshall- I've read a lot of his work too but to call Bukowski brilliant is even more absurd than calling Allen Ginsberg a great poet. If you compare Bukowski with William Carlos Williams, Charles Olsen, Ed Dorn or even Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley you can see straight away that a) Bukowski has NOTHING to say; b) he is totally on an ego-trip; c) he's had a talent bypass.Williams was a great poet because he combined the ability to remake language anew with the strong desire to say something important and to say it in an original way and one that couldn't really have been said remotely as well in any other style. Sure, even Williams (like all great poets) sometimes churned out poor stuff but even if you take Bukowski at his best it's so slight, mannered, insincere and derivative (he mainly copied Williams and Olsen but was not remotely in the same league as the poets he imitated) that it's hard to take it seriously, let alone think it's worth regarding as in any way representing an important contribution to poetry.On the last parts of your comments I have to disagree totally. Poetry is poetry because it's written in verse. That's what makes it a poem; and of course a poem doesn't have to be about 'feeling' - that's a totally Romantic concept of poetry.Poetry can have feeling of course and often does but it's not a prerequisite. And in the case of this Bukowski piece I can find NO evidence of ANY feeling so even on your own principles it doesn't work.'Sometimes only the author knows the meaning of it.'Well, sometimes not even the author does, actually. Leaving aside the question of the so-called 'intentionalist fallacy' some poetry is not even meant to have meaning. Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Christian Morgenstern, Helmut Heissenbuttel, David Gascoyne, Dylan Thomas, concrete and sound poets and so on.So you're again making assertions that are contradicted by the evidence.And it's one thing to be experimenting like, for instance, Eliot, Pound, Williams, Wilbur, Fisher, Gascoyne, Cobbing, Finlay and so on. They all tried hard to rework language and they all had a purpose in mind when they did so.Bukowski is NOT experimenting in this piece; he's simply masturbating his ego on the page.And ALL the great modernist poets were very much concerned with technique; that's why so many of them were also literary critics.Any fool can write a shopping list and pretend it's a poem and that's what Bukowski did with this piece.It takes discipline and focus to experiment genuinely and to make something new.The idea that Bukowski is even singing from the same hymn sheet as Hart Crane, Eliot, Pound, Williams, Lawrence, Owen, Wilbur, Gascoyne, Dorn and so on is so risible it's not even worth the bother of refuting. Anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear can realise that at once.Any author who is too easily happy with what he or she has written will be highly unlikely ever to write work that matters.To write good poetry you have to learn your craft and work at it.You might as well say that anyone can play the piano and that therefore there is no difference between a professional musician playing Chopin or Beethoven or Tchaikovsky and a child banging out 'Three Blind Mice.'I care passionately about poetry and believe me I rarely criticise other people's work and when I do I normally aspire to do so in a positive and constructive way.But that's when I'm commenting on LIVING poets whose work I see on here and who I want to encourage.Bukowski is dead and because he's (allegedly) a 'classic poet' he needs to be held to higher standards.For what it's worth I think even the greatest poets often wrote poor work and I've been quite open about my criticisms of it even when they're by writers who I'm genuinely enthusiastic about.And as for the idea that there's some kind of reader for whom a poem means something (as if the poet had written it just for THEM) well, I think that's a rather strange way of looking at it.But I can see that you belong to the school that believes that 'afflatus is all' and so it's obvious that you reject the very idea of critical standards outright.In your world anything goes.To me that's the philosophy of fascism and I hate and despise it.on Sep 06 2013 10:02 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Beautiful Garbage- I don't compare him to anyone because he is his own person, and writes his own way, he got a lot of bad news from critics but he still wrote what he wanted. And that's commendable. So what he had an ego? He didn't pretend to be anything that he wasn't. And he didn't write anything that he didn't believe, or went through. And truth be told I've never read any of those poets you named (except Lewis Carroll) and I am sure they are great writers, but like I said I don't compare any one writer to another, at least not in a bad way or to say one is better than the other. Sure many are better than others and certainly better than Bukowski but you obviously don't like Bukowski and that is your opinion, so we will agree to disagree there. And yes poetry is more than just how I described it, it is also how you described it, but the beauty of it is that we are free to write in whatever style we choose, and yes we can write a grocery list and call it poetry, but no matter how free the verse, even Bukowski's poem here it has some kind of form to it. even if you don't see it. And when I said sometimes only the author knows the true meaning, I mean also, if it has no meaning at all. We may see something there that isn't or we may not see what is.on Sep 06 2013 04:21 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Jeremy Ephe- I don't know if I am impressed as much with Bukowski's write as I am intrigued with all this misfortune that befell all these famous artists.

It's the kind of thing that you might start off writing and then you'd either work it up into a poem or bin it. Bukowski was a lazy writer who thought he could get away with posting any old crap. I've seen worse from him but he only occasionally IMO rises to the level of a proper poem. Most of the time he's just like a bore at a party - wittering on with nothing to say and most of it about himself!on Sep 03 2013 03:40 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Charles BukowskiFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Charles Bukowski127.4k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Charles BukowskiList all \u00bbThe Laughing Heart18142The Shoelace936air and light and time and space538Hell Is A Lonely Place1049My Cats643No help for that631The Last Days Of The Suicide Kid942The Great Escape1124On The Fire Suicides Of The Buddhists316For The Foxes628Poetry Readings47106Crucifix In A Deathhand61190Poetry Readings2361Gas2237Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/10257717-Beasts-Bounding-Through-Time-by-Charles-Bukowski"}

It is a raw and honest work that doesn't shy away from complex and difficult subjects. Like the other works of the same author, it is also self-critical and a meditation on the struggles of the human soul.Blueis a work that stands out from the works of the author's other works and is a significant contribution to the literature of the 1960s.

Harrison- This poem aches with restrained vulnerability\u2014it\u2019s one of Bukowski\u2019s most haunting and human pieces. The bluebird becomes a symbol of tenderness buried beneath bravado, and the way he both protects and suppresses it is devastatingly relatable. \u201cWe sleep together like that / with our secret pact\u201d\u2014that quiet confession hits harder than any outburst could. There\u2019s such power in the things we hide to survive, especially when art and masculinity demand armor. This poem doesn\u2019t flinch, and that\u2019s what makes it unforgettable.

The metaphor of a cat waiting to jump on a bed creates a sense of impending doom. The speaker's regret and apology for his wife's impending loss are conveyed through his imagined interactions with her after his death. The poem also reveals the speaker's fear of being a burden and his desire for reconciliation.Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem is less characterized by vulgarity and more focused on intimacy and vulnerability. It reflects the poet's preoccupation with themes of mortality, love, and loss, common in his later period. The poem's simplicity and conversational tone contrast with the more experimental and abstract works of his earlier years. By using accessible language and imagery, Bukowski effectively conveys the raw emotions of a dying man's final thoughts and fears.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (55)5Good workLovelyWell writtenLike (55)Likes:brett masters,Sky Spirals,Bee.,Domhnaill,Reed Rosson,EOD,Misanthropus,Frauline,Rucha Dalvi,Khatia Tsiklauri, ,Un.expect.ed,Pen28,Terwilliger Time,FatMaestro,Blue-rekluse-000,Charlie6,Seven of Heaven,Alex Magrath,i2BR02B,Jesse Cabell,Lucemp,Rustedmetal,Richard Weissman,ChD,Bluebird74,Jyotsana Lalotra,Frogautumn48,dys4ia,Erin Cowart,James M.,Einar,Riadasimovg,TriinH,Cynthia Cardoso,ines jia,baranzbk,JC Rogers,Hats,Mark Andrus,Brian Peter Hodgkinson, ,zarref,Zachary Peters,Sammylovesmilfs69,Prefab-sprout,Leenikg,Jillian Moreno,Mczernievska,unknowing artist,Vardopoetry,Jay823,Elias17,Flying penguin7,Service dog,pastpayton,PemalelTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsFlying penguin7- Nicely writtenLiked iton Jul 10 2025 05:19 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserBrian Peter Hodgkinson- this is fabulousThankson Aug 12 2022 10:47 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerwilliger Time- how can you not like this.......Amazingon Mar 27 2021 02:11 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserBrett masters- great human feeling and frailtyon Jan 04 2020 05:33 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- From guest Andrea Suverato (contact)Awesome, in which book is this poem?

It stands in contrast to Bukowski's other works, which often delve into themes of alienation and despair. However, it aligns with the post-modern era's skepticism towards grand narratives and the commodification of art.The poem depicts the \"final curtain\" of a long-running musical, a symbol of society's obsession with entertainment. The speaker, who has not seen the musical, expresses disdain for the spectacle, equating it with the superficiality and emptiness of modern life. While the audience revels in the performance, the speaker remains isolated and untouched, emphasizing the disconnect between the individual and society's pursuit of pleasure.Despite his contempt for entertainment, the speaker acknowledges its utility in keeping people distracted and away from him. This suggests a degree of resignation, as the speaker finds solace in solitude rather than engaging with a society he finds distasteful. The poem thus reflects Bukowski's characteristic cynicism and his belief that true human connection is elusive in a world consumed by entertainment and self-indulgence.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (9)3InspiredAmazingWell writtenLike (9)Likes:Terry Collett,Sky Spirals,Justmore,sdfdfsd,Domhnaill,Terwilliger Time,Sockz,Flying penguin7,pastpaytonTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsFlying penguin7- Greatly pennedWell writtenon Jul 19 2025 08:37 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Great poemon Sep 10 2018 12:09 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- From guest stormy rockweather (contact)Leave me alone!

It conveys a sense of wasted potential, as the rose's failure to blossom during its appointed time implies a failure to seize life's opportunities. The personification of the sun as \"disgusted\" further emphasizes the sense of disappointment and missed chances. Unlike Bukowski's other works, which often explore themes of alienation and self-destruction, this poem takes a more introspective approach, focusing on the consequences of missed opportunities and the potential for regret. It reflects the disillusionment and sense of lost time that was prevalent during the post-World War II era.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (45)4Thank youI enjoyedGood workLike (45)Likes:Sky Spirals,Bee.,Justmore,sdfdfsd,Misanthropus, ,Joshua Sanders,Suleive, ,D.

The speaker declares their satisfaction with their life, contrasting it with the constant striving and dissatisfaction of others. The poem's tone is cynical and critical, particularly toward those who conform to societal pressures or seek validation from others.The poem's staccato rhythm and short lines emphasize the speaker's blunt and matter-of-fact tone. The use of colloquial language and imagery reinforces the poem's down-to-earth style. The poem's conclusion suggests that resilience, humor, and self-acceptance are key to survival, even in difficult times.Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem is relatively straightforward and lacks the explicit vulgarity or sexual themes common in his writing. It aligns with his broader themes of individuality, non-conformity, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (28)6Clever writeEnjoyed itEnjoyableLike (28)Likes:Terry Collett,Pi\u00f1ata Non Grata,Sky Spirals,Justmore,Domhnaill,Eli Sparrow,Pearlesque,Emma286,Papa Mama Jama,Pen28,Terwilliger Time,KittenPoetess,megziepoo2U85,Lucemp,Otyxtyx,Niister77,Luciano di Visco,Bluebird74,Jedlester,Jsaojose8,Caroline Maureen,Random Scribbler,ABarr,AnnW,Zach Camden,Annikasummer,cwtch,AbstractirlTo reply, click a comment.Random Scribbler- Wonderful write up!

The speaker observes a glass bauble, comparing it to a fragile egg and a clear tear. Within this bauble, time seems suspended, preserving moments from the past like a tapestry. The inhabitants of this bauble are described as light and busy, similar to other poems by the author that examine the domestic sphere. The poem contrasts this idyllic scene with the harsh reality of the present, where a woman is stranded in a barren landscape, her shadow a reminder of her past suffering.

I picked it because after reading it, I had no clue what she was trying to say.Here is what I have come up with so far.I believe this is about the final moments of a woman in a hospital. Listed are some of the things I've made note of.  These are just my opinions though.1.) \"Flick the glass with your fingernail:It will ping like a Chinese chime in the slightest air stir\"I believe this refers to a needle, and some antidote in a glass bottle.  Nurses pluck the needle to make sure there's no air in it.2.)\"Though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer.The inhabitants are light as cork,Every one of them permanently busy.\"If you've been to a hospital, you know exactly what it's like.  Everyone is moving somewhere, doing something.3.)\"As Victorian cushions. This familyOf valentine faces might please a collector:They ring true, like good china.\"I interpretted this as being the worried family members of the patient in the hospital.4.)\"A woman is dragging her shadow in a circle\"When someone is down to their last moments in life, my guess is that they would be thinking about everything in the past, and the things they've done wrong, or their \"shadows.\"5.)\"And appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg.She lives quietly\"Blitzkrieg being a type of military warfare, this woman has endured enough of her own internal conflicts with herself, and now she's getting ready to experience the quiet after the storm.6.)\"She has one too many dimensions to enter.Grief and anger, exorcised,Leave her alone now.\"This is where the woman dies, and all of the fears and feelings she had been holding on to have left her now.7.)\"The future is a grey seagullTattling in its cat-voice of departure.Age and terror, like nurses, attend her,And a drowned man, complaining of the great cold,Crawls up out of the sea.\"The last lines sum up any kind of life-after-death scene, with the future being grey, and pretty much void.That's what I've made of it so far.

She doesn't need this, doesn't waste time on it.Now for the pure genius of her word play...again the theme of isolation and even a glass jar reference.

Plath's use of juxtaposition\u2014contrasting the sacred figures of the Nativity with the secular imagery of department store displays\u2014highlights the tension between religious devotion and consumerism.Compared to Plath's other works, \"A Winter's Tale\" is more explicitly political and less introspective. It reflects the disillusionment and alienation characteristic of her later period, which is evident in her novel \"The Bell Jar.\"The poem's setting in Boston, a historical and cultural hub, adds another layer of irony as the city's Puritan heritage clashes with the rampant consumerism depicted. Plath's use of local landmarks and businesses further grounds the poem in the time period.Overall, \"A Winter's Tale\" is a sharp and critical commentary on the societal pressures and materialism that can overshadow the true spirit of the holiday season. Its juxtaposition of sacred and secular imagery effectively conveys the sense of alienation and disillusionment that permeated the mid-20th century.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (5)0LovelyInspiredGood workLike (5)Sylvia PlathFollowBorn in 1932 to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem at the age of eight.

The speaker warns against dissecting a bird, flaying a beast, or plucking out a heart to understand their inner workings.The poem uses the metaphor of scientific dissection to represent the act of trying to understand something deeply. The speaker suggests that this process can be destructive, and that we may end up destroying the very thing we are trying to learn about.The imagery in the poem is graphic and unsettling, and the tone is one of warning. The speaker's voice is authoritative, and the poem's message is clear: we should be careful not to dissect and analyze things too much, lest we destroy them.This poem is similar to Plath's other works in its use of dark imagery and its exploration of themes of death and loss. It is also characteristic of her work in its use of metaphors and similes to create a vivid and evocative image.The poem is also reflective of the time period in which it was written. The middle of the 20th century saw a great deal of scientific and technological advancement, and there was a growing belief in the power of science to solve all of humanity's problems. However, Plath's poem suggests that there are some things that science cannot explain, and that we should be cautious about trying to dissect and analyze everything.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (66)7Enjoyed itFantasticGood workLike (66)Likes: ,Rissa C,D.

She goes where no man or women has ever gone before.on May 03 2007 03:34 PM PSTEditDelete- \"Admonition\" might not be in the style warming us to her going on at least celebrating an observation, but this is warning to just give the reader like a manual to not have a nullification of animals for a careless section, so an abbreviation that can lose its appreciation in the spreads, as said elsewhere .I needed someone to sit me down tonight and point out something, and Sylvia Plath had that way, with a no not nonsense but everything not straightened.  So, I think these are traits as well we can't be trist with by the straits. The first stanza has such delicate curtailing when getting something intact in isolation.  And such oxymoronic events are on the earth with macro, micro, and mucho macho ways but mankind will have understaning by siding to not be the monster of menace but take the startle of how we're jointed for good, eco and own.The second 4 lines go opposite from internal lovelies to externals but turns a stomach to hang that as a trophy of purpose of all to see only, like scalping personalities or literal taxidermists' results if empty acknowledgement went on the wall.The last is without riddle to not just do autopsy but empathy for some study with true eagerness of existence, as my daughter says lala-ha.on Mar 04 2007 05:57 PM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192-preposition-- Her flow seemed interrupted on the last line of each stanza, I didn't count the meter, but this seems an unsual write from dear plath...

The poem's detached tone and use of third-person observers underscore the dispassionate fascination that disasters evoke.Compared to Plath's other works, \"Aftermath\" is less confessional and more observational. It aligns with the broader post-World War II literary trend of exploring the psychological and social impact of trauma. The poem's use of impersonal language and lack of specific details suggest a collective experience of loss and detachment.The poem's brevity and understatement give it a powerful impact.

It begins with a sense of stasis and emptiness, but then bursts into a vibrant and visceral depiction of transformation and liberation. The speaker identifies with both Ariel, Shakespeare's ethereal spirit, and Godiva, the legendary naked horsewoman.The poem reflects Plath's exploration of themes such as female empowerment, the search for identity, and the struggle against societal constraints. It is characteristic of her confessional style, with its raw emotions and startling imagery. Compared to her earlier work, \"Ariel\" shows a departure from the more traditional forms and language of her debut collection, \"The Colossus.\" It is more experimental and fragmented, reflecting her evolving poetic style and the tumultuous period in which it was written.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (211)67Good job!Thank youWell writtenLike (211)Likes:Asad Mehmood,ozzylord,Leira,Sword of the Soul,Shiningexcavator,Eddard Grimpike,Soyam-29,Jonna,Floracaroline19,jaysxorbit, ,T.F.

I don't know what exactly Sylvia had in mind when she wrote this, but to me it feels as if taking the name of this character, she gave it a new meaning as a poignant and bludgeoning spirit or entity that floats in the beginning of dawn, static and then hurls itself upon the morning, very well could be a distorted and imagery rich way to describe a simple sun rise, yet with taints of artermath or wrecked hopes, a shadow that seems to not even be broken by 'the cauldron of morning' as she wrote, and it only turns into 'The dw that flies, suicidal'. You would think of sunrise as gentle and delightful, yet she has painted it in a very rich and interesting atmosphere of distress as if waking up not from a nightmare, but waking to the morning's real nightmare after the numbing blackness of a nightsky. ~ Juan Anguason May 15 2004 06:39 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Bloodsucker Boss- More inenbriating goodness from everyone's favorite toxic genius.I am always amazed at Plath's pathogenic stanzas,plateauing and stalling on the edge between meaningless,cryptic wordplay and divine,pensive masterwork.This poem is a great example,shifting from something to substance with every other line,keeping you on the edge of you seat in anticipation of the cathartic climax that will never come.My favorite line:\"Eye, the cauldron of morning.\"on Sep 17 2003 07:46 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Sylvia PlathFollowBorn in 1932 to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem at the age of eight.

It depicts the protagonist sending back the key to a forbidden room, suggesting a rejection of male control and a reclamation of autonomy.The poem's brevity and repetition add weight to each word, emphasizing the protagonist's agency and the perceived threat of the \"study.\" The use of \"X-rayed\" and \"dissected\" evokes images of vulnerability and objectification, conveying the protagonist's fear of being consumed by the patriarchal figure.Compared to Plath's other works, \"Bluebeard\" exhibits similar themes of female victimization and resistance found in \"Daddy\" and \"Lady Lazarus.\" However, it differs in its focus on agency rather than victimhood, marking a shift towards a more empowered stance.The poem's context within the post-World War II era resonates with the evolving social norms and expectations surrounding gender roles. Plath's critique of male power and female submission reflects the shifting dynamics and the ongoing struggle for women's autonomy.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (12)0Lovely jobEnjoyableAmazingLike (12)Sylvia PlathFollowBorn in 1932 to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem at the age of eight.

The speaker expresses a desire to fill the child's gaze with beauty and wonder, symbolized by \"color\" and \"ducks,\" reflecting the transformative power of childhood. However, the poem also hints at the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead, as the \"troublous\" and \"dark\" aspects of the world begin to intrude upon the child's innocent perspective.Compared to Plath's other works, \"Child\" stands out for its relative lack of overt darkness and despair. While elements of her characteristic bleakness are present, the poem also conveys a sense of hope and potential. This is evident in the speaker's wish to provide the child with a world filled with beauty and meaning, even as she acknowledges the presence of adversity.In its portrayal of the complexities of motherhood, \"Child\" reflects the social and cultural norms of the time period in which it was written. The speaker's desire to shape and protect her child's vision of the world mirrors the prevailing belief that mothers had a significant role in molding the future character and well-being of their children. However, the poem also hints at the limitations of this role, as the child's path is ultimately shaped by both their own experiences and the broader social and environmental forces that surround them.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (28)5Clever jobGood workThanksLike (28)Likes:Skye Darkholme, ,Rachel Thomas37,The Tellurian,june panic,Ken Doll,Dreams-writer,Pseudopsycho.,I'm Offline,Reshmeeka,Ay, ,PigDemon17, ,Sweet Nostalgia,Paula Griffith,D.

They say that she would scrutinize her word choices and analyze her poems for quite some time. Knowing this, when I read her poety, I often wonder why she chose certain wordings and certain little bizarre things I find. I wonder why she chose to say \"eye\" instead of \"eyes,\" which seems much more logical.I hate the third line, it irks me to a great degree. I hate that she rhymes \"zoo\" with \"new.\" I don't know why. it just REALLY bothers me.This is a cute poem. I like it, but Ms. Plath was not known to write \"cute\" poems, and I definitely don't think it's her greatest. Nevertheless, not every amazing poet has to write an amazing poem every time she puts her pen to paper. It's very childlike, and I think that's what she was trying to portray.

The 3 quatrains of this sonnet are complex and seem to suggest an emotional context of guilt and anxiety amidst a physical setting of opulence. These 2 contexts correspond to the glitter and misery of Sylvia Plath's life.The tour de force couplet is far more powerful and immediate: the caustic ticking of the midnight clock indicates the climax of psychological agony that has been building all evening.Please write me if you are a Plath fan as well.Inspiredon Sep 01 2022 10:45 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Stephen76- The flagon with the dragon holds the brew that is true.on Aug 24 2022 07:52 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserKindel Sol- This is fire!

This is an earlier piece, and Ariel (and her novel The Bell Jar) are what she's best known for. Also, a definitive bio of Plath, Red Comet, just came out. It's more than 1,000 pages long, but worth it if she interests you.on Nov 08 2020 01:20 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserVince4- I'm intrigued by how many people here think Plath just wrote this.

Then they pour out their f-f-f-feelings... aw don't get me started.\u00a0 (Get off my lawn!!)on Dec 20 2020 09:40 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserVince4- I must confess McKuen was the first poet I read and enjoyed. (I was in high school and my tastes unformed.) Now I'm embarrassed. There's a classic text -- I think it's Understanding Poetry -- that actually devotes a chapter to defining bad poetry, and McKuen's is one example.on Dec 20 2020 02:27 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserIslandtime- Lol I don't even wanna think about what I watched/read/listened to in HS. Lewis Turco's poetry textbook (I think it's called \"An Introduction Through Writing\" but don't quote me) has a long section about Mckuen. On a more humble level, I have a parody posted in here called Poetry and Poetics 101.

The brief fairy tale, the ticking of the clock to represent the cruel hand of fate that time is ticking away. She is aware of the time.And the \"trance,\" she describes reveals how isolated she might have felt, in knowing she was aware of the clock and of her decline, yet others remained oblivious.on Jun 12 2005 03:41 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- This is one of her better poems in terms of imagery and use of imperfect rhyme in the last 2 stanzas to parallel the frenzied countdown to midnight and the anxiety she feels.  Maybe at one time Plath herself felt a little like Cinderella and the caustic ticking of the clock parallels her countdown to suicide.  I think of this as one of her better poems.on Jul 31 2004 01:29 PM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Attesa- I think of it as a loss of time. Like every fairy tale must end especially with the last line.

A sensitive person who tended to be a bit of a perfectionist she was what many would consider a model daughter and student - popular, a straight A student, always winning the best prizes. She won a scholarship to Smith College in 1950 and even then she had an enviable list of publications.

It compares love to a journey with a clear destination. The poet contrasts this with the uncertainty of the future, arguing that it is unwise to delay gratification.The poem's focus on youth and the transience of time is in line with the themes of other works by the author. It also reflects the social context of the time, when the Black Death had made people acutely aware of the fragility of life.The poem's simple structure and use of rhyme scheme make it easy to understand and remember. The language is also relatively straightforward, with few complex or obscure words. This makes it accessible to a wide range of readers.Overall, the poem's message about the importance of living in the present is timeless and relevant to readers of all generations.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1082)453Liked itWell writtenGood work!Like (1082)Likes:Michael Griffiths,fieldnotes,Flowers4santa,Marcella.k, ,Lenadrwilson,Young Learner,Stella B.,Eddard Grimpike,AthenaAlkidemos,Little paw,Unknownstudent,Tale,A.S.V., ,Uri Oto Osar,SoulSymphonies,Aeris Yong,Veromenvil, ,Emmaa120933,Dedfish,Shadesofcool2009,Millionmiles,Lothl\u00f3rien -Lauren,thebluelagoon,Overthemoon5,Leachim,Julian7, ,Kallon,Perfect-Evil008,R.McF,Messiah taiwo,Pattis50, ,Mychelle,azraelg,zains812,Whispering Slowly,Jojojoking,Cornerwriter,Loreto,Warmcookies,Cecelia Blight,Levi-Ackerman,Chesa liwayway,Jenna Carpenter,Maca.T.a.,Izy, ,Nic984,Thyselfbetrue,thegirlnextdoor.,BIM2,Cadie,Devesh425,Idreaminlofi,pastpayton,Ayusp,inaganlu,Alice26,Jiller, ,K0k0r0,mandanamoon,RustAndRuin,Lilireinhart25,Bruisedviolet,Sylvia337To reply, click a comment.\u2190 Previous12345Next \u2192All at once\u2022Older commentsJDArt24- Love, such a beautiful invention. thanks for sharing.on Sep 27 2025 03:20 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTila- Captured romanticallyon Sep 17 2025 03:20 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserThelordreigns- AI leaves out so much and is really not appropriate for poetry analysis!

The speaker urges the beloved to seize the moment, warning that waiting brings no reward. With its musical rhythm and playful tone, the poem blends carpe diem philosophy with romantic longing.

It is however a question of faith at all times... One must always justify the value of freedom with the value of responsibility... If two lovers are at polar odds with that value then their opposing odd will only grow stronger in that value until they either accept the responsibility or run away.... Everyone has dreams.... fantasies of a character they act out to become... if the world does not accept it within the faithful time that you spend improving it.... Choose responsibility... But never also forget to choose happiness... even in the struggles of all bad things... choose to see beauty and never ever give up finding warmth in the company of others...

Love the rhyming. DeborahAmazing.on Sep 27 2020 05:32 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMegabob- This is very definitely not a sonnet. Although Shakespeare is famous for his sonnets. it should be noted that a sonnet is a very restrictive form. there are two types of sonnets. a Petrarchan or Italian Sonnet, which came first or a Shakespearean or English sonnet which came second. The English sonnet as you can guess is closely associated with Shakespeare as he pioneered their use. a sonnet is and always was a 14 line poem, no more, no less. additionally both variants of the sonnet use Iambic pentameter. An Iamb being an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one. there should be 5 iambs precisely per line resulting in ten syllables per line with the same stress pattern through out. the Sonnets start to differ at the Rhyme scheme which is also strictly set. A Petrarchan Sonnet has a Rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDEor at timesABBA ABBA CDC DCDas you can see, the Italian Sonnet is split into an octave and a sestet.the English sonnet, which I personally are more familiar with, has a Rhyme scheme of:ABAB CDCD EFEF GGThis form also usually possesses a twist, or a Volta. usually located at the start of the third stanza. This twist could be a resolution to a problem presented in the previous lines or some other things. The line for this reason usually starts with a \"but\". the other thing to note about an English sonnet is the function of the ending couplet. The ending couplet should serve to sum up the poem in a concise way and tie off the entire thing.due to its strict and demanding form, a Sonnet is a very interesting writing exercise to improve your writing, even if you don't prefer the style. There are arguments about Sonnets as a form growing more lax over the years, but rest assured that this poem, is most definitely not a sonnet.Thank you for coming to my ted talk. and congratulations if you read all the way.on Nov 12 2020 08:28 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Agrt- Excellent summation - however, you answered your own answer.

He realizes that Cesario is not only a girl but has a twin brother. \r\n\r\n\"Journey's end in lovers' meeting/Every wise man's son doth know.\" is indicating that once they all find who it is they love that the journey will be done but that Cesario (Viola) knows this because she is constantly referring to herself as a man throughout the play. This just helps to cover it up more.\r\n\r\nThis song is also more of a joke because everyone takes Feste as a big joke but he is the only one who doesn't change who he is for anyone else.

The speaker remembers the pain of losing loved ones and regrets the time wasted on past mistakes. However, when the speaker remembers their cherished friend, it brings a sense of comfort.This poem differs from Shakespeare's other works, such as his sonnets, which often focus on romantic love and beauty. Instead, \"Dear Friend\" explores the complex emotions of loss and remembrance. It also aligns with the themes of melancholy and the passage of time prevalent in the Elizabethan era.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (12)1Lovely!Nicely doneEnjoyed itLike (12)Likes:The Tellurian, ,Museum of Anhedonia,Pokee,D.

The speaker's wish to be \"laid\" in \"sad cypres\" and their shroud \"stuck all with yew\" symbolizes mourning and sorrow. They also reject flowers and friends at their grave, seeking isolation and the avoidance of sympathy. The poem's brevity and repetitive language convey the speaker's intense grief and desperation, while the absence of hope and comfort reflects the despair and desolation of unrequited love. In comparison to Shakespeare's other works, this poem displays a concise and somber tone, lacking the complexity and grandeur of his plays and sonnets. It aligns with the conventions of Elizabethan funeral dirges, expressing the pain and loss associated with death.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (8)3AmazingI enjoyedLiked itLike (8)Likes:Terwilliger Time,teesamai, ,D.

Orsino is suffering from pangs of love and is questioning Viola who he believes to be a boy. He wants to hear a sad love song he has heard the night before and is told it was sung by the clown Feste, who is of Olivia's household. Feste is sent for and as requested sings the song and is then paid by Orsino.The song is deliberately melancholy and nostalgic to match and reflect Orsino's mood at this point.on May 29 2004 12:02 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Ahkam- \"COME away, come away, death,And in sad cypres let me be laid;Fly away, fly away, breath;I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\"this is the job of a really talented poet that like a saint he always welcome the death ____ not considering that the only solution of his problems or any sort of escape but to compare the feelings of death with the sweet pain of Love.This is wonderful.on Feb 21 2004 09:33 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Philophant- Dark, but lovely.

It exhorts the reader to cast aside their fears, as all worldly possessions and pursuits are ultimately transient. The poem's simple yet powerful language conveys the universality of death, which affects all individuals, regardless of their status or station in life.The poem's structure consists of four stanzas, each of which begins with the refrain \"Fear no more.\" This repetition emphasizes the inevitability of death and the futility of dwelling on worldly concerns. The imagery of \"golden lads and girls\" and \"chimney-sweepers\" highlights the leveling effect of death, reducing everyone to dust.The poem's themes also resonate with the Elizabethan era's preoccupation with mortality and the transience of life. The poem's somber tone and themes of mortality align with the cultural attitudes of the time period.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (5)3Lovely poemWell writtenGood workLike (5)Likes:D. M.

Shakespeare uses simple and straightforward language, yet the words are full of meaning and emotion. The speaker, Mark Antony, uses repetition and rhetorical questions to build momentum and persuade the crowd to his point of view.The poem is similar to other works by Shakespeare in its use of blank verse and its exploration of complex themes such as ambition, loyalty, and the nature of good and evil. However, this speech is unique in its direct address to the audience and its use of irony and sarcasm.The poem is a reflection of the turbulent political climate of Shakespeare's time. It is a reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of reason and compassion.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (14)4GreatInspiringLovelyLike (14)Likes:Terry Collett,Natureobazee,Treeofknowing,Bethifer,Bliss5,Korallen Lang,Johan Regan,M.V.Tanner,D.

The lines explore themes of beauty, desire, and violence through rich imagery and symbolism. Each part of Lucrece's body becomes a metaphor for her vulnerability. Her hand, once a symbol of modesty, now covers her face, suggesting both shame and defiance. Her eyes, \"like marigolds,\" are closed in sleep, like flowers that have withdrawn from the world.Tarquin's lust is likened to a predator's hunger, while Lucrece becomes his prey. The poem's language is both sensual and brutal, reflecting the conflicting emotions at play. The description of Lucrece's physical beauty contrasts sharply with the violence and terror she experiences. The lines also highlight the power dynamics between men and women in the time period, as Lucrece's vulnerability is used to justify Tarquin's actions. Compared to Shakespeare's other works, this excerpt shares the themes of desire, power, and the consequences of violence, exploring them through a different lens of sexual assault and its aftermath.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)1FantasticGreatInspiredLike (2)Likes:Terry Collett,CasuarinaTerry Collett- Great poemon Feb 01 2020 08:00 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserWilliam ShakespeareFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By William Shakespeare2.3k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by William ShakespeareList all \u00bbSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting (Hamlet Act V, Scene II)521Sweet-and-twenty16Dear Friend112Love620From Venus And Adonis13When That I Was And A Little Tiny Boy24The Blossom22Helen's Soliloqy (All's Well That Ends Well)15Now The Hungry Lion Roars28Macbeth - Three witches casting a spell611Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow525Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears414Some Say That Ever \u2018Gainst That Season Comes (Hamlet, Act I, Scene I)27The Canakin Clink Pub Song (From 'Othello')12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326602-From-The-Rape-Of-Lucrece-by-William-Shakespeare"}

from forth a copse that neighbours by,A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud;The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;The iron bit he crushes 'tween his teethControlling what he was controlled with.His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging maneUpon his compass'd crest now stand on end;His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,Shows his hot courage and his high desire.Sometime her trots, as if he told the steps,With gentle majesty and modest pride;Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,As who should say, 'Lo! thus my strength is tried;And this I do to captivate the eyeOf the fair breeder that is standing by.'What recketh he his rider's angry stir,His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say?'What cares he now for curb of pricking spur?For rich caparisons or trapping gay?He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.Look, when a painter would surpass the life,In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,His art with nature's workmanship at strife,As if the dead the living should exceed;So did this horse excel a common one,In shape, in courage, colour, pace and boneRound-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,Save a proud rider on so proud a back.Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;To bid the wind a race he now prepares,And whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;She answers him as if she knew his mind;Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,Beating his kind embracements with her heels.Then, like a melancholy malcontent,He vails his tail that, like a falling plumeCool shadow to his melting buttock lent:He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.His love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.His testy master goeth about to take him;When lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,With her the horse, and left Adonis there.As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.I prophesy they death, my living sorrow,If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.\"But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,Or at the roe which no encounter dare:Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,And on they well-breath'd horse keep with they hounds.\"And when thou hast on food the purblind hare,Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troublesHow he outruns with winds, and with what careHe cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:The many musits through the which he goesAre like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.\"Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:\"For there his smell with other being mingled,The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singledWith much ado the cold fault cleanly out;Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,As if another chase were in the skies.\"By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,To hearken if his foes pursue him still:Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;And now his grief may be compared wellTo one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.\"Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretchTurn, and return, indenting with the way;Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:For misery is trodden on by many,And being low never reliev'd by any.\"Lie quietly, and hear a little more;Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,Applying this to that, and so to so;For love can comment upon every woe.\"\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):This excerpt from Venus and Adonis depicts a spirited horse with vivid imagery. The description of the horse's physical attributes, from its rounded hooves to its glossy hide, is reminiscent of Shakespeare's other works, such as Sonnet 18, where he compares his love to \"a summer's day.\" However, this poem stands out for its focus on the horse's emotions and instincts.The horse's pursuit of the mare reflects the theme of love and desire prevalent in the Elizabethan era. Its fierce determination and disregard for its rider's commands convey a sense of untamed passion. The horse's interaction with the mare, characterized by both submission and resistance, parallels the complex dynamics of human relationships.Compared to the time period, the poem exhibits a blend of traditional and innovative elements. While the use of nature as a metaphor for love is common in Renaissance literature, Shakespeare's vivid descriptions and focus on the horse's emotions mark a departure from conventional depictions of animals.Ultimately, this passage exemplifies Shakespeare's ability to combine vivid imagery, keen observation, and universal themes to create a memorable and enduring work of art.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (3)1Amazing!InspiredGood workLike (3)Likes:Terry Collett,Shruti9,Amanda SandsTerry Collett- Classicon Apr 06 2020 01:40 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserWilliam ShakespeareFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By William Shakespeare3.1k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by William ShakespeareList all \u00bbSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting (Hamlet Act V, Scene II)521Sweet-and-twenty16Dear Friend112Love620When That I Was And A Little Tiny Boy24The Blossom22Helen's Soliloqy (All's Well That Ends Well)15Now The Hungry Lion Roars28Macbeth - Three witches casting a spell611Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow525From The Rape Of Lucrece12Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears414Some Say That Ever \u2018Gainst That Season Comes (Hamlet, Act I, Scene I)27The Canakin Clink Pub Song (From 'Othello')12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326609-From-Venus-And-Adonis-by-William-Shakespeare"}

The speaker, Helen, recognizes that her love for Bertram is innate and irresistible, yet unfulfilled. She questions the forces that seem to prevent their union, suggesting that they lie within herself rather than external circumstances.In comparison to other sonnets by Shakespeare, this one stands out for its philosophical depth and introspection. It delves into the nature of love and the human condition, exploring the tensions between desire and reality.The sonnet also reflects the intellectual and courtly culture of the Elizabethan era, with its emphasis on reason, logic, and the exploration of human nature. Helen's soliloquies often reflect on the power of love and the challenges of reconciling it with social expectations and personal fulfillment.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (5)1LovelyGood workGreatLike (5)Likes:Terry Collett,Sarah Gosa,Elenielly,Matey,D.

The reader sees these concepts contrasted through the image of a \"Heavenly Clause\" offering a \"Crown of Life\" in exchange for unwavering faithfulness. However, the poem's speaker rejects this offer, suggesting that true loyalty is not conditional upon reward or recognition.This poem differs from Dickinson's other works in its direct and concise language. Unlike many of her other poems, which use intricate imagery and metaphorical language, this poem conveys its message through straightforward and clear diction. Additionally, the poem's brevity and lack of punctuation contribute to its impact, creating a sense of urgency and immediacy.The poem also reflects the changing social and cultural norms of the time period. During the Victorian era, which saw a rise in religious fervor and moral conservatism, the idea of unwavering loyalty and submission to authority was widely upheld. However, Dickinson's poem challenges these prevailing values by suggesting that true loyalty should not be based on external rewards or societal expectations.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (21)3Good workLiked itGreat!Like (21)Likes:laura0757,ShaN on,L Char,Skye Darkholme,Letter10155,Josephine M G,William Pencraft,Cathysalesmftphdpoet,Anonymouspoet06,SincerelyNatalie,LilRimbaud, ,Apollo Loomis,Dgreat ken, ,Codesterlalit,Tip.H,charlieboy316,Lalalazarus,Frogtiger41,Cesar Liz SouzaTo reply, click a comment.Charlieboy316- This speaks of one jilted, betrayed by the one she loved, unspeakable duress, a heart terribly broken but not contrite.Inspired.on May 21 2023 02:06 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- Beautiful!on May 16 2021 06:37 AM PSTEditDeleteCathysalesmftphdpoet- Beautiful lyricsLovely poston Apr 21 2021 02:26 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserEmily DickinsonFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Emily Dickinson4.0k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Emily DickinsonList all \u00bbThe Murmur of a Bee214Too happy Time dissolves itself413The Murmur of a Bee49A Little Road Not Made Man24An English Breeze12I Measure Every Grief I Meet (561)19The Brain Within Its Groove310A Great Hope Fell29Elysium Is As Far As To22A Little Dog That Wags His Tail26I Hide Myself Within My Flower03To Lose Thee1Water Makes Many Beds0A Little Snow Was Here And There2247046Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326722--Faithful-To-The-End--Amended-by-Emily-Dickinson"}

It suggests that reflecting on past grief can provide a sense of perspective and healing, as symbolized by the fading of grass over a grave. The imagery of the \"Mighty Funeral\" and the \"Unremembered Drop\" conveys the magnitude of grief and the eventual diminishment of its intensity. The poem's simplicity and use of everyday language make it relatable to readers experiencing loss. Compared to Emily Dickinson's other works, it shares themes of death, nature, and the healing power of memory. In terms of the time period, the poem reflects the Victorian era's preoccupation with mourning and the search for comfort in the face of loss.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (4)1Nicely doneLovelyEnjoyed itLike (4)Likes:Skye Darkholme, ,Bluebird74,Lalalazarus- beston May 28 2019 03:54 AM PSTEditDeleteEmily DickinsonFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Emily Dickinson833 views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Emily DickinsonList all \u00bbThe Murmur of a Bee214Too happy Time dissolves itself413The Murmur of a Bee49A Little Road Not Made Man24An English Breeze12I Measure Every Grief I Meet (561)19The Brain Within Its Groove310A Great Hope Fell29Elysium Is As Far As To22A Little Dog That Wags His Tail26I Hide Myself Within My Flower03To Lose Thee1Water Makes Many Beds0A Little Snow Was Here And There2247046Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326774--Tis-Good-Mdash-The-Looking-Back-On-Grief-by-Emily-Dickinson"}

Compared to Dickinson's other works, it shares her characteristic brevity and use of dashes, but it lacks the floral imagery and personal experiences often found in her poetry.The poem's exploration of time aligns with the Victorian fascination with transience and mortality. It questions the reliability of tomorrow, suggesting it may be an illusion that offers false comfort for present troubles. By contrasting it with \"Albi art thou,\" the poem implies that tomorrow may be a deliberate deception concocted to mask the harsh realities of life.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)1Lovely writeGreatLiked itLike (2)Likes:Trevor McLeod,CodesterlalitTrevor McLeod- legitimate concernon Feb 12 2020 09:44 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserEmily DickinsonFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Emily Dickinson1.4k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Emily DickinsonList all \u00bbThe Murmur of a Bee214Too happy Time dissolves itself413The Murmur of a Bee49A Little Road Not Made Man24An English Breeze12I Measure Every Grief I Meet (561)19The Brain Within Its Groove310A Great Hope Fell29Elysium Is As Far As To22A Little Dog That Wags His Tail26I Hide Myself Within My Flower03To Lose Thee1Water Makes Many Beds0A Little Snow Was Here And There2247046Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326691--Tomorrow-----whose-location-by-Emily-Dickinson"}

The juxtaposition of comfort and dying creates a sense of dissonance, highlighting the fragility of life and the inevitability of its end. The ticking clock and knocking wind provide temporary distractions from the \"Dying Room,\" but their persistent and impersonal nature underscore the relentless passage of time. The children's play further emphasizes the contrast between life and death, underscoring the tragedy of losing the speaker's companion while others continue to live. The final lines express a sense of injustice and despair at the arbitrary nature of death, which takes the speaker's loved one while sparing the innocent.Compared to Dickinson's other works, this poem is relatively concise and straightforward in its language, yet it captures the same haunting and introspective tone. It reflects the themes of mortality, nature, and the search for meaning in the face of life's uncertainties. The poem's brevity and lack of embellishment contribute to its powerful impact, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (4)2LovelyLiked itAmazingLike (4)Likes:Sarah Gosa,William Pencraft, ,charlieboy316To reply, click a comment.Charlieboy316- very goodInspiredon Jul 01 2023 06:50 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- superon May 17 2019 10:54 PM PSTEditDelete-on May 18 2019 06:49 AM PSTEditDeleteEmily DickinsonFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Emily Dickinson1.4k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Emily DickinsonList all \u00bbThe Murmur of a Bee214Too happy Time dissolves itself413The Murmur of a Bee49A Little Road Not Made Man24An English Breeze12I Measure Every Grief I Meet (561)19The Brain Within Its Groove310A Great Hope Fell29Elysium Is As Far As To22A Little Dog That Wags His Tail26I Hide Myself Within My Flower03To Lose Thee1Water Makes Many Beds0A Little Snow Was Here And There2247046Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326638--Twas-comfort-in-her-Dying-Room-by-Emily-Dickinson"}

It captures the speaker's profound appreciation for the gift of life, emphasizing its dual aspects: the physical birth and the spiritual connection with someone special. The poem's concise language and simple imagery evoke a sense of wonder and gratitude, conveying the speaker's awe at the marvel of existence.Compared to Dickinson's other works, this poem shares her signature themes of mortality, eternity, and the search for meaning. However, it differs in its celebratory and optimistic tone, contrasting with the more somber and introspective nature of many of her other pieces. The poem also reflects the Victorian era's fascination with spirituality and the exploration of the afterlife, as seen in the speaker's references to \"Thee\" and the implication of a spiritual connection beyond physical death.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (6)4Enjoyed itEnjoyed itGreatLike (6)Likes:Letter10155, ,Terwilliger Time,Andrew Blitman,Ms T Poet,DareredTo reply, click a comment.Darered- Girl, in the future, we have 420, and it is always such somewhere xBlessing to you, Em.

The grass is infused with a \"chilly Peace,\" and the sun remains respectful, casting no intrusive rays. The shadows are still and scrutinizing, implying a sense of watchful waiting. The poem suggests that all humans, regardless of their differences, are gathered in this peaceful state, freed from their daily burdens and obligations.Compared to Emily Dickinson's other works, this poem is relatively straightforward and concise. It lacks the dense imagery and complex metaphors that characterize many of her other poems. However, it still captures her preoccupation with themes of mortality, peace, and the nature of existence.In the context of its time period, the poem reflects the growing sense of disillusionment and skepticism following the Civil War.

Unlike ordinary clocks, this one cannot be fixed by human intervention, suggesting the irreversible and relentless nature of time's passage. The poem's use of scientific language, with references to \"Geneva's skill,\" \"Decimals,\" and \"Degrees,\" adds a layer of precision and objectivity to the concept of time.Compared to Dickinson's other works, this poem displays her preoccupation with the themes of transience and mortality. It echoes her other poems that explore the brevity of life and the inevitability of death. However, unlike some of her more somber works, this poem maintains a sense of detached observation, capturing the impassive nature of time's progression.In the context of the time period during which it was written, the poem reflects the Victorian fascination with the passage of time and the human experience of it. It aligns with the Romantic movement's emphasis on the interplay between nature and human emotion, as the clock's stillness is juxtaposed with the natural progression of time represented by the \"cool,\" \"concernless No.\" The poem's use of scientific language also reflects the increasing scientific and technological advancements of the era, which influenced many writers and thinkers of the time.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (14)6FantasticGreatInspiredLike (14)Likes:Mrs Campbell,Tburger2002,Hosein shafiei bidgoli,John32,Solsticegreen51,Terwilliger Time,Cardigan Fitz,Michael E Cantrall,WolfDragon12,Seven of Heaven,PsychicWitness,Bluebird74, ,TonyglockTo reply, click a comment.Mrs Campbell-Would Emily be happy with AI evaluating her poetry?

The poem's simple language and short, concise lines convey a sense of urgency and conviction. Compared to Dickinson's earlier works, such as \"Because I could not stop for Death\" and \"Hope\" is the thing with Feathers -,\" this poem lacks the same level of figurative language and complexity.

The speaker initially expresses annoyance with the bird's constant singing, but later acknowledges his own fault and the beauty of the song. This change of perspective suggests a reconciliation between human and natural worlds.The poem's simplicity and direct language contrast with the complexity of its themes. The use of short, declarative sentences creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The conversational tone draws the reader into the speaker's inner struggle.Compared to Frost's other works, \"A Minor Bird\" is less overtly symbolic and more focused on personal experience. It reflects the prevailing themes of nature and self-awareness in Frost's poetry. The poem's brevity and clarity make it accessible to a wide range of readers.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (61)17Enjoyed it!FantasticEnjoyed itLike (61)Likes:RobertRichard,waydownuponjoy,Terry Collett,DianeAH,forever thinking,brett masters,Zai Luna Fortuna, ,R\u00e2\u0113le la-lune,L Spirit,lola lawal,Joe Fettig,Vaishkhushi,William Pencraft,Temi Cotek,menace to linear time,DarkLadybug, ,Ashany,Nick Esposito,Un.expect.ed,IntoxicatedLover,Jordano,Papolyt,Familiar12,alchemy s march, ,Shakil,Sounak Sinha,Kevin Kuepfer, ,Messypalette,Richard Reed, ,digitalgrandpa,Mani Mohan Ojha,Cardigan Fitz,Bhaskar Mukharjee,DaisiesAndFae, ,Orkida Muca,Eclipse MacTagge,Bellsnoel,Fallgreen84,Seipher38,Harvey'oLewiathans,Raven Spirit,Ken Doll,M.

And I begin to fear they never will. All they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered. Nearer in plight their neighbors are than distance.SMOKE- I am the guardian wraith of starlit smoke that leans out this and that way from their chimney. I will not have their happiness despaired of.MIST- No one - not I would give them up for lost simply because they don't know where they are. \u00a0I am the damper counterpart of smoke that gives off from a garden ground at night. But lifts no higher than a garden grows. I cotton to their landscape. That's who I am. I am no further from their fate than you areSMOKE- They must by now have learned the native tongue. Why don't they ask the red man where they are?MIST - They often do, and none the wiser for it. So do they also ask philosophers who come to look in on them from the pulpit. They will ask anyone there is to ask - In the fond faith accumulated fact - will of itself take fireand light the world up. Learning has been a part of theirreligion.SMOKE - If the day ever comes when they know who they are, they may know better where they are. But who they are is too much to believe - either for them or the onlooking world. They are too sudden to be credible.MIST - Listen, they murmur talking in the dark on whatshould be their daylong theme continued. Putting the lamp out has not put their thought out.

Mist expresses doubt about the sleepers' awareness of their surroundings and their place in the world. Smoke, on the other hand, insists on their resilience and the potential for enlightenment.The poem reflects Frost's preoccupation with isolation and the search for self-knowledge. Compared to his other works, it shares themes of uncertainty and human limitations. However, it also incorporates a philosophical dimension, exploring the nature of reality and the relationship between inner and outer worlds.The conversation between Mist and Smoke suggests a perpetual cycle of questioning and searching. The sleepers represent the human condition, striving for knowledge and an understanding of their existence. The poem's use of personification and imagery creates a dreamlike atmosphere, blurring the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical.Moreover, the poem comments on the limitations of conventional learning and the pursuit of external validation. Mist and Smoke suggest that true enlightenment comes from within, through introspection and a connection with nature. The ending leaves a sense of mystery and unresolved questions, mirroring the ongoing nature of our own existential journey.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (6)5LovelyWell writtenThank you!Like (6)Translated by Jose Domingo GarciaLikes:Terry Collett, ,Amy Elizabeth Stares,Ken Doll,CBRussell,KindPoetTo reply, click a comment.- kudosNicely done!on Dec 30 2018 10:18 PM PSTEditDeleteAmy Elizabeth Stares- Killed it !on Sep 16 2018 10:04 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Very good workon Apr 20 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poem and themeon Oct 26 2018 12:05 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poemon Aug 02 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Fine poemClever jobon Jul 17 2018 12:25 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poemon Jul 03 2018 12:26 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Classic poemon May 13 2018 12:04 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserNana Penn- Inspired!Simple, yet complex.\u00a0 Love Robert Frosts poetry/Summarize the story:\u00a0 They must by now have learned the native tongue.

You rememberYou said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,The early Mormons made a settlementAnd built a stone baptismal font outdoors-But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountainTo go West to a worse fight with the desert.You said you'd seen the stone baptismal font.Well, take me there.'Someday I will.''Today.''Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?Let's talk about it.''Let's go see the place.''To shut you up I'll tell you what I'll do:I'll find that fountain if it takes all summer,And both of our united strengths, to do it.''You've lost it, then?''Not so but I can find it.No doubt it's grown up some to woods around it.The mountain may have shifted since I saw itIn eighty-five.''As long ago as that?''If I remember rightly, it had sprungA leak and emptied then. And forty yearsCan do a good deal to bad masonry.You won't see any Mormon swimming in it.But you have said it, and we're off to find it.Old as I am, I'm going to let myselfBe dragged by you all over everywhere- ''I thought you were a guide.''I am a guide,And that's why I can't decently refuse you.'We made a day of it out of the world,Ascending to descend to reascend.The old man seriously took his bearings,And spoke his doubts in every open place.We came out on a look-off where we facedA cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,Or stained by vegetation from above,A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.'Well, if I haven't brought you to the fountain,At least I've brought you to the famous Bottle.''I won't accept the substitute. It's empty.''So's everything.''I want my fountain.''I guess you'd find the fountain just as empty.And anyway this tells me where I am.''Hadn't you long suspected where you were?''You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?Look here, you treat your guide with due respectIf you don't want to spend the night outdoors.I vow we must be near the place from whereThe two converging slides, the avalanches,On Marshall, look like donkey's ears.We may as well see that and save the day.''Don't donkey's ears suggest we shake our own?''For God's sake, aren't you fond of viewing nature?You don't like nature. All you like is books.What signify a donkey's cars and bottle,However natural? Give you your books!Well then, right here is where I show you books.Come straight down off this mountain just as fastAs we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.It's hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.'Be ready, I thought, for almost anything.We struck a road I didn't recognize,But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoesIn dust once more. We followed this a mile,Perhaps, to where it ended at a houseI didn't know was there. It was the kindTo bring me to for broad-board paneling.I never saw so good a house deserted.'Excuse me if I ask you in a windowThat happens to be broken, Davis said.'The outside doors as yet have held against us.I want to introduce you to the peopleWho used to live here. They were Robinsons.You must have heard of Clara Robinson,The poetess who wrote the book of versesAnd had it published. It was all aboutThe posies on her inner windowsill,And the birds on her outer windowsill,And how she tended both, or had them tended:She never tended anything herself.She was 'shut in' for life. She lived her wholeLife long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.I'll show You how she had her sills extendedTo entertain the birds and hold the flowers.Our business first's up attic with her books.'We trod uncomfortably on crunching glassThrough a house stripped of everythingExcept, it seemed, the poetess's poems.Books, I should say!- if books are what is needed.A whole edition in a packing caseThat, overflowing like a horn of plenty,Or like the poetess's heart of love,Had spilled them near the window, toward the lightWhere driven rain had wet and swollen them.Enough to stock a village library-Unfortunately all of one kind, though.They bad been brought home from some publisherAnd taken thus into the family.Boys and bad hunters had known what to doWith stone and lead to unprotected glass:Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?By being invisible for what it was,Or else by some remoteness that defied themTo find out what to do to hurt a poem.Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,To send it sailing out the attic windowTill it caught wind and, opening out its covers,Tried to improve on sailing like a tileBy flying like a bird (silent in flight,But all the burden of its body song),Only to tumble like a stricken bird,And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.Books were not thrown irreverently about.They simply lay where someone now and then,Having tried one, had dropped it at his feetAnd left it lying where it fell rejected.Here were all those the poetess's lifeHad been too short to sell or give away.'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.'Why not take two or three?''Take all you want.'Good-looking books like that.' He picked one freshIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.He read in one and I read in another,Both either looking for or finding something.The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.I was soon satisfied for the time being.All the way home I kept rememberingThe small book in my pocket. It was there.The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heavenAt having eased her heart of one more copy-Legitimately. My demand upon her,Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.In time she would be rid of all her books.\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):In \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books,\" Robert Frost weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature. The poem's protagonist embarks on a journey to rediscover a long-lost fountain, but his quest ultimately leads him to a profound encounter with the written word.Like many of Frost's other works, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is characterized by its vivid imagery and deceptively simple language. The poem's opening lines establish a sense of anticipation and wonder as the speaker learns of a mysterious mountain that holds promise of great fortune. However, as the journey progresses, the speaker's hopes are gradually dashed, and he is confronted with the harsh realities of time and change.The poem's central metaphor, the fountain, serves as a powerful symbol of the protagonist's longing for connection and meaning in life. Like the mythical Fountain of Youth, the fountain represents a desire to escape the limitations of time and find renewal. However, just as the protagonist's physical search for the fountain proves futile, so too does his search for spiritual fulfillment in the external world.Ultimately, it is through his encounter with the poetess Clara Robinson's books that the protagonist finds a sense of solace and purpose. The books become a metaphor for the power of literature to transcend the boundaries of time and provide a window into the human experience. Frost's portrayal of the poetess's \"shut in for life\" condition suggests the transformative power of art to liberate the spirit even in the face of physical limitations.In its exploration of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is a characteristically complex and moving poem by Robert Frost.

It evokes a sense of nostalgia and childhood innocence.Unlike Frost's other works, such as \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" this poem lacks philosophical undertones and instead focuses on a charming and relatable anecdote.The poem paints a vivid picture of a girl's determination and playful nature. It highlights her desire for independence and her willingness to work hard to achieve her goal.The use of colloquial language and humor adds a sense of authenticity and warmth. The girl's antics, such as running away from her \"not-nice load\" of dung, show her youthful exuberance.Overall, \"A Girl's Garden\" stands as a testament to the joys and challenges of childhood and the power of memories to shape our lives.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)0Good workGreatThanksLike (7)Robert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost8.5k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326593-A-Girl-s-Garden-by-Robert-Frost"}

The sun's a wizardBy all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.From the high west she makes a gentle castAnd suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,She has her speel on every single lizard.I fancied when I looked at six o'clockThe swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.The moon was waiting for her chill effect.I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rockIn every lifelike posture of the swarm,Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.Across each other and side by side they lay.The spell that so could hold them as they wereWas wrought through trees without a breath of stormTo make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.One lizard at the end of every ray.The thought of my attempting such a stray!\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):The poem depicts the transformative power of nature through a hillside thaw. It captures the allure and fleeting beauty of the event, comparing it to a wizard's magic and a witch's spell. The sun's warmth initially rouses the \"silver lizards\" (drops of water) from the snow, but it is the moon's chill that ultimately freezes them in place. The poem's vivid imagery and dynamic language evoke a sense of wonder and awe at the natural world. Compared to Frost's other works, it shares themes of nature, the interplay of light and shadow, and human attempts to control the uncontrollable. It reflects the era's fascination with naturalism and the power of the natural world.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)1LovelyGood workWell writtenLike (2)Likes:Skye Darkholme,- very very wordy need to digest slowly to appreciateon Jun 24 2019 04:27 AM PSTEditDeleteRobert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost3.4k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326581-A-Hillside-Thaw-by-Robert-Frost"}

It reflects Robert Frost's signature themes of transience and missed opportunities. Compared to his other works, it is relatively concise and accessible, lacking the complex symbolism and dense language found in poems like \"The Road Not Taken\" and \"Birches.\"Set against the backdrop of the industrial era, the poem captures the tension between progress and a longing for connection with the natural world. The speaker's glimpse of flowers from a passing train symbolizes the fleeting beauty that often escapes our grasp. The train's relentless forward motion represents the march of time, which leaves behind moments that can be appreciated only retrospectively.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)0Enjoyed itLovelyGood workLike (2)Robert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost7.1k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326575-A-Passing-Glimpse-by-Robert-Frost"}

The snow's \"speckled with grime\" surface evokes memories, like the faded headlines of a forgotten newspaper. This suggests a lost past, events and experiences that have faded from memory.Frost's use of \"a blow-away paper\" captures the ephemeral nature of both snow and memory. Just as the wind can scatter newspapers, time can erode our memories, leaving only fragments behind. The poem's brevity and stark imagery create a sense of loss or a longing for what has been forgotten.Compared to Frost's other works, such as \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" this poem lacks the vivid descriptions of nature. Instead, it focuses on the interplay between memory and the physical world, exploring the subtle ways in which past experiences shape our perception of the present.Set in the early 20th century, the poem captures a sense of nostalgia and the changing landscape of time. The newspaper metaphor references a form of communication that is now largely obsolete, further emphasizing the sense of a bygone era.Overall, \"A Patch of Old Snow\" is a minimalist and introspective poem that examines the fragility of memory and the fleeting nature of experience. Its simplicity and understated imagery leave room for contemplation and personal interpretation.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (31)9LovelyInspiringFantasticLike (31)Likes:RobertRichard,I-Like-Rhymes,Terry Collett,DianeAH,Pedro J Garcia,Skye Darkholme,Lady Iridescent,L Spirit, ,Vaishkhushi,RaveEnding,DVAted,William Pencraft,menace to linear time,Spoken Poet, ,Lsenyane,Ashany,David Welch,Matcha2000,Huggleberry Gin,Singh27,alchemy s march, ,r99040721m, ,Messypalette,Ddwil09,Bhaskar Mukharjee,f2399,Stephen76,Gwen D.,Alena Vyshemirskaia,Ken Doll,Jordan Pallotta-To reply, click a comment.Alena Vyshemirskaia- such a subtle beauty in this poemon Apr 28 2020 11:22 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserQueenOfDarkenDreams.- kudosNicely doneon May 09 2019 10:43 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserI-Like-Rhymes- A poem (and a message) worth remembering.on Jan 26 2019 05:09 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserDianeAH- I have always liked this poem.\u00a0 The same today as it was back then. forgotten news.\u00a0 It doesn't take long for today's to become forgotten yesterdays.on Jan 25 2019 07:57 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Classic poemon Apr 20 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poem and themeon Jun 29 2018 11:49 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMenace to linear time- I just love iton Jan 02 2018 03:13 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRobertRichard- incredible!Enjoyed iton Nov 20 2017 05:33 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- Poems from a bit of trash.

The narrator's youthful belief that dust carries gold symbolizes the initial optimism of the gold seekers. However, the repetitive line \"I was one of the children told\" underscores the inevitability of disappointment as the dream of wealth fades.The poem captures the ephemeral nature of the Gold Rush. The dust that promised fortune becomes merely a nuisance, highlighting the fragility of human hopes. Unlike Frost's earlier work, which often celebrated rural New England life, \"A Peck of Gold\" reveals a more urban and disillusioned perspective, reflecting the social and economic changes that swept the nation during the late 19th century.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (10)2GreatI enjoyedGood workLike (10)Likes: ,Thor lover 95,Eric Seaburg,Keng,Hanging Petals, ,Ricardo Montolivo,biirdbraiin,Wynnie1,Sam Mushtaq- The necessity of optimism and the corresponding disappointment when it is unrealised.on Oct 21 2024 10:57 PM PSTEditDeleteKenny Wilson- Fineon Nov 04 2022 05:39 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRobert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost7.5k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326592-A-Peck-of-Gold-by-Robert-Frost"}

Angelou contrasts images of conflict and destruction (battlefields, coliseums) with those of peace and reconciliation (children playing with dolls in flags of truce, pennants waving in the breeze). The poem suggests that humans are complex creatures, capable of both great love and great cruelty.This poem is similar to Angelou's other works in its exploration of themes of race, identity, and social justice. However, it is unique in its focus on the power of human potential for both good and evil.

The invader takesdirection andseeps through the plaster walls.It is at my chamber, enteringthe keyhole, pushingthrough the padding of the door.I cannot scream. A boneof fear clogs my throat.It is upon me. It issunrise, with Hopeits arrogant rider.My mind, formerly quiescentin its snug encasement, is strainedto look upon their rapturous visages,to let them enter even into me.I am forcedoutside myself tomount the light and ride joined with Hope.Through all the bright hoursI cling to expectation, untildarkness comes to reclaim meas its own. Hope fades, day is goneinto its irredeemable placeand I am thrown back into the familiarbonds of disconsolation.Gloom crawls aroundlapping lasciviouslybetween my toes, at my ankles,and it sucks the strands of myhair. It forgives my headyfling with Hope. I amjoined again into itsgreedy arms.\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):This poem explores the themes of hope and despair, and the cyclical nature of life. The speaker begins in a state of safety and comfort, but is soon invaded by fear. The fear grows and becomes overwhelming, until the speaker is unable to speak or breathe. However, just as the fear reaches its peak, it is replaced by hope. The speaker is then filled with joy and expectation, and rides out on a wave of light and hope. But this hope is short-lived, and the speaker is soon thrown back into despair. The poem ends with the speaker being consumed by gloom, but still holding onto the memory of hope.The poem is written in a free verse style, and uses vivid imagery and metaphors to create a powerful and moving effect. The language is simple and direct, but the poem's meaning is complex and multifaceted. The poem can be seen as a metaphor for the journey of life, which is often filled with both hope and despair. The poem can also be seen as a commentary on the human condition, and the way in which we are often trapped by our own fears and limitations.The poem is similar to Angelou's other works in its exploration of themes of hope, despair, and resilience. However, it is unique in its use of a cyclical structure to explore these themes. The poem also differs from Angelou's other works in its use of a more direct and personal voice. The speaker of the poem is not a specific character, but rather a representation of Angelou's own experiences and emotions. This gives the poem a more universal and timeless quality.Overall, \"A Placid Journey\" is a powerful and moving poem that explores the complex themes of hope, despair, and resilience. The poem's use of vivid imagery, metaphors, and a cyclical structure creates a powerful and lasting impact on the reader.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (3)1Clever workLiked itLiked itLike (3)Likes:Terry Collett,Trenea3,Terry Collett- A classic poemon Jun 30 2019 08:11 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMaya AngelouFollowMaya Angelou, born April 4, 1928 as Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, was raised in segregated rural Arkansas.

It resembles Angelou's other works in its themes of resilience, self-expression, and affirmation. Compared to the time period (1970s), the poem reflects the growing cultural and social consciousness of the Black Power movement, with references to prominent figures in various fields.The poem's simple but effective imagery, use of repetition, and conversational tone create a sense of celebration and empowerment. It captures the vibrant essence of Black life, from everyday activities to artistic endeavors, highlighting the diversity and richness of the Black experience.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (9)3Well writtenLiked itFantasticLike (9)Tip:  The rhythm of your lines and spaces is _Learn commentingLikes:Terry Collett, ,Shida,Paige336,Quietstorm,Bosgal,Pascal P,Idontchoosename,SwazzzykjTo reply, click a comment.Swazzzykj- holy rizz this poem is straight fire my jit\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18on Nov 19 2024 09:13 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserIdontchoosename- This poem is sigmaon Nov 19 2024 09:09 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poem and themeon Mar 09 2019 08:01 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMaya AngelouFollowMaya Angelou, born April 4, 1928 as Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, was raised in segregated rural Arkansas.

It echoes themes of isolation, poverty, and societal suffering found in other works by the author, who often addressed racial and social injustices. The poem's simple and repetitive structure emphasizes its central message, while the use of contrasting imagery (e.g., \"water is not thirst\" vs. \"bread loaf is not stone\") reinforces the idea that true fulfillment can only be found in human connection.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (170)77LovelyEnjoyed it!AmazingLike (170)Likes:PBrad, ,F.

Their wives are running around making a loud complaint about their imminent demise(banshees are traditionally female harbingers of death and disaster) and their children are singing sad songs (blues).As for the stress on \"alone\" that IMHO is obvious. We all need to help each other - nobody can survive completely on their own.But like a lot of poetry what it means to you depends on the history you carry around with you.

The curtains struggle against the wind, symbolizing the resistance to the inevitable. The sleeping children exchange dreams with angels, creating a sense of serenity. The city, on the other hand, is portrayed as harsh and unwelcoming, dragging itself awake on subway straps. The speaker, isolated and ignored, lies awake like a \"rumor of war,\" highlighting the loneliness and alienation of urban life. Compared to Angelou's other works, this poem shares themes of isolation and the struggle for identity in a bustling and indifferent world. It also reflects the time period of its creation, capturing the sense of urban disillusionment prevalent in the mid-20th century.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (9)1EnjoyableInspiredAmazingLike (9)Likes: , ,Tadrian.

The land is described as ancient and worn, with adobe bricks that have faded over time. In contrast, David is full of life and energy, his presence injecting activity and music into the languid air.

The poem challenges societal perceptions and discrimination, emphasizing the speaker's resilience and determination. Compared to Angelou's other works, \"Equality\" shares her themes of identity, resistance, and social justice. The poem's strong rhythmic structure and use of repetition convey a sense of urgency and the speaker's unwavering resolve. However, it differs from some of Angelou's more personal works by focusing on a collective experience of oppression and the collective struggle for equality. The poem captures the spirit of the Civil Rights Movement and reflects the broader historical context of the period.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (20)6Good workAmazingI enjoyedLike (20)Likes:peabody,Ryan McKenzie,William Pencraft,Poethope26,Stephen76,CatherineJane,Deedra Tinsley, ,Amaya8,Fahad Herculean,Sweet Songbird,Miamooroo,Miamoopoo,SuKoRo,Maria-Hoyt,Michelle Dunn6,Christina A Howe,Woopdee woop,Roza Szeleczky,Aurora Sage5To reply, click a comment.Aurora Sage5- so inspiringon Apr 06 2025 01:23 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserWoopdee woop- cool gameron Aug 30 2024 10:37 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserPeabody- confess you've heard me crying,and admit you've seen my tears. \"Humanity is the expressed creation of the Creator, a body of unique and precious spirits of living water connecting each of us to the aquifers of His love...

The imagery of the \"dirge of desolation\" and \"ballast of the rock\" conveys the weight of oppression and societal ills, while the progression from \"crawling\" to \"soaring\" symbolizes the indomitable spirit of humanity. Despite the horrors inflicted upon them, the subjects of the poem persist in their growth and triumph over adversity, offering a message of hope amidst despair.Compared to the author's other works, \"Glory Falls\" shares similarities in its exploration of social justice and the power of the human spirit. However, it differs in its more somber and introspective tone, delving deeper into the depths of human suffering and the struggle for survival.Within the context of its time period, the poem reflects the experiences of marginalized communities during the Civil Rights Era, who faced rampant discrimination and violence. It serves as a powerful indictment of societal injustice and a testament to the enduring spirit of those who persevere in the face of adversity.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (3)1GreatWell writtenInspiringLike (3)Likes: ,Shida,Maria-HoytShida- Niceon Dec 11 2019 11:18 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMaya AngelouFollowMaya Angelou, born April 4, 1928 as Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, was raised in segregated rural Arkansas.

Hisdinner dishes were undone, his breakfast dishes were undone, he needed a shave, and ashfrom his rolled cigarettes dropped onto his undershirt. Some of the ash was still burning.Sometimes the burning ash missed the undershirt and hit his skin, then he cursed, brushingit away. There was a knock on the trailer door. He got slowly to his feet and answered thedoor. It was Constance. She had a fifth of unopened whiskey in a bag.\"George, I left that son of a bitch, I couldn't stand that son of a bitchanymore.\"\"Sit down.\"George opened the fifth, got two glasses, filled each a third with whiskey, two thirdswith water. He sat down on the bed with Constance. She took a cigarette out of her purseand lit it. She was drunk and her hands trembled.\"I took his damn money too. I took his damn money and split while he was at work.You don't know how I've suffered with that son of a bitch.\" \"Lemme have a smoke,\" said George. She handed it to him and as she leaned near,George put his arm around her, pulled her over and kissed her.\"You son of a bitch,\" she said, \"I missed you.\"\"I miss those good legs of yours , Connie. I've really missed those goodlegs.\"\"You still like 'em?\"\"I get hot just looking.\"\"I could never make it with a college guy,\" said Connie. \"They're toosoft, they're milk toast.

He said, \"Connie, you have beautiful legs.\"He asked for another cigarette.

She ran her fingers through George's hair, stroking him, soothinghim. Soon he was asleep. She waited a while longer. Then she lifted his head and placed iton the pillow, lifted his legs and straightened them out on the bed. She stood up, walkedto the fifth, poured a jolt of good whiskey in to her glass, added a touch of water anddrank it sown. She walked to the trailer door, pulled it open, stepped out, closed it.

The setting is a squalid trailer, where George, the protagonist, is living a life of poverty and self-neglect. The arrival of Constance, who has left her abusive husband and stolen his money, brings a sense of excitement and chaos into George's life.The poem is notable for its stark and realistic portrayal of life at the margins of society. Bukowski's language is blunt and unadorned, reflecting the characters' own rough existence. The dialogue between George and Constance is full of profanity and sexual innuendo, capturing the raw and impulsive nature of their relationship.The poem also explores themes of masculinity, power, and desire. George's initial passivity and self-hatred give way to a sense of lust and control when he sees Constance's legs. Constance, on the other hand, is both vulnerable and defiant, expressing both her desire for George's physicality and her frustration with the constraints placed on women in society.Compared to Bukowski's other works, \"A Man\" is relatively short and straightforward. However, it shares many of the same themes and stylistic elements as his other poems, including the exploration of social outcasts, the rejection of societal norms, and the celebration of the raw and uncompromising aspects of human nature.In the context of its time period, the poem reflects the growing social unrest and disillusionment of the 1960s and 1970s. Bukowski's gritty and anti-establishment writing style resonated with countercultural movements of the time, which rejected traditional values and embraced a more authentic and rebellious way of life.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (13)5Great postWell writtenFantasticLike (13)Likes:Sky Spirals,Domhnaill,Reed Rosson,Emma286,Rucha Dalvi,i'm your huckleberry,Terwilliger Time,Grace Wilson,Rustedmetal,Blessedbeauty,priyanshrajmahendra,Ruthyvbz,Gerta233,pastpaytonTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsGerta233- Niceon Jan 30 2025 11:27 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserDomhnaill- hilariouson Sep 24 2022 07:16 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserPriyanshrajmahendra- Can someone tell me the meaning of last line \"They all knew each other.\" ?on Feb 15 2022 05:13 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserEmma286- My current ability to know how best to interpret most poems I read isn't good.

It suggests that true creation stems from an inner drive that transcends external obstacles and material possessions.The poem's brevity and straightforward language underscore its central message: that neither ideal surroundings nor freedom from obligations can guarantee artistic output. Instead, the speaker asserts that creativity persists amidst adversity, disability, and chaos.Bukowski's perspective aligns with his other works, which often explore themes of alienation and the struggle for authenticity in a superficial world. It also reflects the social and economic realities of his time, where many aspiring artists faced financial and logistical challenges. By challenging the notion that external factors determine artistic success, the poem encourages a deeper understanding of the complexities of the creative process.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (38)5InspiredGood workGood postLike (38)Tip:  Does it create a picture in your mind?Learn commentingLikes: ,Sky Spirals,Bee.,Out-lier,Tmishael,Zoe McMillan,Terwilliger Time,SculptorPoet,Charlie6,Alex Magrath,Luciano di Visco,Bluebird74,Saba1,Nick Pierce, , ,Rebeca2,Einar,J.

It employs a refrain of \"the impossibility of being human,\" emphasizing the unattainable nature of a perfect or fulfilling existence. Bukowski's language is raw and unflinching, mirroring the pain and chaos of the subjects' lives. Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem exhibits a wider historical scope and a focus on literary figures. It reflects the post-World War II era's disillusionment and exploration of existential themes, aligning with the modernist movement in its fragmented structure and rejection of traditional poetic conventions.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (124)59FantasticEnjoyableWell writtenLike (124)Likes:Kimberly Cassels,Petergarnett58, ,Zion monday,Juneedvenson,Richom,Yonathan Asefaw,Poet Kiptoo,Jason3,Un.expect.ed,octoberseventh, ,OneHazard,Ashleighonly,ParisBlue,deadmeatmobile,Solsticegreen51,broski,Irish Rose,Cubed Thoughts, ,Terwilliger Time,Summerling,Jared W,Powerblue62,IsabellaRose1820,Saplingpower87,FatMaestro,Lady-Pumblechook,Alek the Poet,Byrn Brynhild-Rus,Ahmed Jouini,Anno Domini,witchofarea51,Dani Printz,Michael Gentile,Aleks0.0, ,Samson Shillitoe,Benathor,megziepoo2U85,Alex Magrath,Hefe,Luciano di Visco,Irregardless,LoriCrockett32,ZTR,Civil War Camel, ,Einar,Burges,Jsaojose8,Jules656,Angelique Narag,Layne Green,InConquest,Faith Tysinger,Skyabove, ,Such-a-dork,AfkPoppinTabs,whypyongyang,Arturo Ruiz Iii,M.

Whether he was drunk or being lazy, it does not lessen the power of this poem and the talent of the writer. For those below who apparently did not understand, in poetry you dont have to follow the rules, and therein lies the beauty of it. His words are tragic and bitter truth. The impossiblities of being human is that nothing is impossible or shocking anymore. We are defined by superior intelligence and articulate speech and standing erect. But do we not first learn to crawl? When we lose the superior intelligence and articulate speech we begin to be just like the other animals. The very definition of human being is \"a person, esp. as distinguished from other animals or as representing the human species.\" This states that we, too, are animals. And it is in our human nature to act like animals at times, to kill is not beyond us, though we should know better, unless in self defense, but in self defense that means that someone was trying to kill us. So what really seperates us from the animals? When some animals are more honorable and courageous and loyal and kind and loving than many human beings. and more intelligent. Being human is an impossiblity. We are all animals.on Sep 05 2013 10:27 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Linda Marshall- I find it impossible NOT to dislike this piece. It is NOT a poem in any shape or form (and as someone who loves genuine modernism I have to say I think Bukowski is a total fake) and there is NO power in the piece nor any sign of talent in the writer.It's got nothing with following rules; it's got to do with saying something original and fresh.Actually to write GOOD modernist poetry is HARDER than writing good traditional stuff.And Bukowski is NOT good at it; largely because he was a talentless poseur.on Sep 05 2013 03:56 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192M. Covert Payton- You are possibly the most arrogant, self-congratulatory purveyor of ridiculosity that I have *ever* encountered on this site. The number of hypocrisies and self-negating statements in these comments about this poem are virtually innumerable. And that fact that you insinuate that Allen Ginsberg is not a great poet is irredeemable.You can hate Bukowski all you want; you're a woman, so you're going to hate some of what he says right off the bat (most of those things I hate myself, re: his poetry). But to say that \"it's not poetry\" AND that \"it's no good\" (& especially what you seem to say, \"the main reason it's no good is because it's not poetry\") shows such a fundamental lack of understanding of what poetry is that I'm amazed that you can even write about it at all. \"Poetry is poetry because it's written in verse\" is a meaningless statement . . . you know why? Because the word \"verse\" actually means \"line\" -- a \"verse\" is a *part* of a poem -- technically it's a single LINE of a poem -- and YES there are \"formal\" verse patterns, but there is also a thing (an invention of those \"modernists\" that you laud so highly) called \"free verse\" in which the METER (which is really what you are TRYING to talk about, as the \"essential\" item of a \"poem\") is broken up amongst the lines, and in fact a \"formal\" meter is NOT required.And if you think Bukowski didn't \"learn his craft\" and \"work at it\" then that's just further evidence of your elitism and fundamental lack of understanding of how poetry *really* works, and what it *truly* is.Name-dropping all the great poets you've read? Check. Throwing out literary terms and definitions in a way that shows that you don't truly understand them? Check. Saying that Bukowski's poetry is like a \"laundry list\" and that he's \"masturbating\" onto the page and that he's only writing about himself and that his ego is running rampant? Check, check, check, check.I'm checking off the items on a list: it's a list of people that Bukowski was most determinedly NOT WRITING FOR . . . because they are a group of people with a hollow understanding of the root of language itself, and a group who designates a hallowed ground that can only be occupied by those who play by their rules. And when you say \"In your world, anything goes ... To me that's the definition of fascism and I hate and despise it\" it shows two things: 1) You have NO IDEA what fascism is, as a philosophy or as a politic; and 2) YOU are actually much, much closer to being a Fascist than Bukowski, or any of these other posters . . . \"anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear can see this at once\"on Nov 11 2020 05:38 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Linda Marshall- You are entitled to like Bukowski; I find it sad that you can't just accept that people don't share your hero-worship and look on him as a talentless poseur.And I haven't attacked you so why you feel that you are entitled to launch a personal attack on me is a mystery.Perhaps you are like those cultists who cannot bear to see their idols dissed in any way.I'm not going to get into any issue of 'qualifications;' I leave that to elitist snobs.And as someone who had family members murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis and for whom racism is an everyday reality I find your suggestion that I have no\u00a0 idea what fascism is both sad and laughable.And all Bukowski does is masturbate his senile ego on the page because he is too lazy, too arrogant and too narcissistic to bother to learn his craft.This particular poem IS like a laundry list and he IS an egotistical self-adorer.You can choose to worship him if you want but the clear 'message' of your words are: a) I'm a woman so I don't know what I'm talking about; b) I don;t like Bukowski so I must be stupid; c) I dare to criticise him so I must be arrogant even to DARE to say anything BAD about your Deity.It's a clear attempt to intimidate me and it won't work and I'm seriously considering whether or not to take the matter up with the mods of this forum.As it happens I am the co-ordinator of the Old Poetry Research Team and I routinely add poems, translations, authors and comments on the work of HUNDREDS of poets.I've got a BA Honours in English and History and I can speak and translate from six languages.So just because I'm a woman and a gypsy doesn't make me stupid or unqualified to express my opinion, mush!on Nov 12 2020 07:50 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192M.

But you know what the problem is? You don't express those things as an *opinion* you express them as incontrovertible FACTS. Which, to me, is reprehensible. That, added to your generalized hypocrisy, is what's so upsetting to me.Well, there's also your insanely transparent use of the old \"ad hominem\" argument. . . Because, you see, I was doing something in my comment -- I was using YOUR style of argumentation, and I was *trying* to be humorous about it . . . i wanted to see if you could \"get it\" . . . and (of course) you did not.Let's see: You say:\"I'm not going to get into any issue of 'qualifications;' I leave that to elitist snobs. \"But THEN -- 5 lines later -- you say:\"As it happens I am the co-ordinator of the Old Poetry Research Team and I routinely add poems, translations, authors and comments on the work of HUNDREDS of poets.I've got a BA Honours in English and History and I can speak and translate from six languages.\"And *I* say: Hypocrisy. One of MANY examples ...And THEN you write:Perhaps you are like those cultists who cannot bear to see their idols dissed in any way.Please -- I mean it -- show me where I showed ANY \"hero worship\" to Bukowksi, in my original post. Also, show me where I said you were \"stupid or unqualified to express my opinion, mush!\" I never said you were stupid; I simply said that your methodology of stating your dislike of Bukowski was arrogant and condescending. Saying \"I hate Bukowski\" is one thing; explaining your hatred as a manifestation of something inherently \"wrong\" in his poetry? That is arrogance as well as condescension. You have a \"BA in Honors English\" well great! Does that mean that the PhDs and MFAs who are teaching Bukowski's poetry as an expemplification of either late Modernism or early Postmodernism, and pointing out his use of rhyme (internal and final), meter, and lyricism, don't know what they're talking about? That you know more then they do?Once again, it's your arrogance and condescion that rubs me the wrong way. If you could just take the time and energy to *really* look at ANY poetry, then you should be able to come out and say \"Well, *I* don't like it, because to ME it feels like he's not honed his craft & he's masturbating his senile ego onto the page\" then I never would have commented. YOU typically state your OPINIONS as FACTS, and you disparage anyone who disagrees with your opinions as \"hero worshippers.\"I don't care how many \"poems, translations, authors and comments\" you've put up here, or anywhere else; that's great that you are \"the co-ordinator of the Old Poetry Research Team\" . . . that doesn't make you an authority on ANYTHING.And I couldn't care less about Bukowkski; I love his poetry SOMETIMES, but at least I'm intelligent enough to look at poetry that I don't like (especially that has sold HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of books (of poetry!) and be able to say \"well I don't like it, but I would NEVER presume to say that it's worthless\" -- which is exactly what you did.

I am reading a lot of his work right now, and the man is brilliant. He doesnt hold anything back, he tells it like it is. and he doesn't care who's feelings he hurts. He is very descriptive and really puts an image in your head. This is just one of his poems, and I liked it. I got a message from it, and I dont care what form it is in. Poetry is poetry because it allows us to write what we feel, whether in free verse or a set form. Poetry is not meant to be criticized because sometimes only the author really knows the meaning of any of it. It is meant to inspire and to be an outlet for our feelings and thoughts when we dont know how else better to say or describe them. I dont get into the technical with poetry, modern, traditional. It doesn't matter to me, as long as the author is happy with it and accomplished what he wrote it for. If I don't like something or disagree with something I may comment on it, but I won't bash anyone's work simply because I dont like it or understand. It may not relate to you, but it relates to others, and if it reaches just one person and makes them think then the goal has been reached.on Sep 06 2013 07:35 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Linda Marshall- I've read a lot of his work too but to call Bukowski brilliant is even more absurd than calling Allen Ginsberg a great poet. If you compare Bukowski with William Carlos Williams, Charles Olsen, Ed Dorn or even Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley you can see straight away that a) Bukowski has NOTHING to say; b) he is totally on an ego-trip; c) he's had a talent bypass.Williams was a great poet because he combined the ability to remake language anew with the strong desire to say something important and to say it in an original way and one that couldn't really have been said remotely as well in any other style. Sure, even Williams (like all great poets) sometimes churned out poor stuff but even if you take Bukowski at his best it's so slight, mannered, insincere and derivative (he mainly copied Williams and Olsen but was not remotely in the same league as the poets he imitated) that it's hard to take it seriously, let alone think it's worth regarding as in any way representing an important contribution to poetry.On the last parts of your comments I have to disagree totally. Poetry is poetry because it's written in verse. That's what makes it a poem; and of course a poem doesn't have to be about 'feeling' - that's a totally Romantic concept of poetry.Poetry can have feeling of course and often does but it's not a prerequisite. And in the case of this Bukowski piece I can find NO evidence of ANY feeling so even on your own principles it doesn't work.'Sometimes only the author knows the meaning of it.'Well, sometimes not even the author does, actually. Leaving aside the question of the so-called 'intentionalist fallacy' some poetry is not even meant to have meaning. Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Christian Morgenstern, Helmut Heissenbuttel, David Gascoyne, Dylan Thomas, concrete and sound poets and so on.So you're again making assertions that are contradicted by the evidence.And it's one thing to be experimenting like, for instance, Eliot, Pound, Williams, Wilbur, Fisher, Gascoyne, Cobbing, Finlay and so on. They all tried hard to rework language and they all had a purpose in mind when they did so.Bukowski is NOT experimenting in this piece; he's simply masturbating his ego on the page.And ALL the great modernist poets were very much concerned with technique; that's why so many of them were also literary critics.Any fool can write a shopping list and pretend it's a poem and that's what Bukowski did with this piece.It takes discipline and focus to experiment genuinely and to make something new.The idea that Bukowski is even singing from the same hymn sheet as Hart Crane, Eliot, Pound, Williams, Lawrence, Owen, Wilbur, Gascoyne, Dorn and so on is so risible it's not even worth the bother of refuting. Anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear can realise that at once.Any author who is too easily happy with what he or she has written will be highly unlikely ever to write work that matters.To write good poetry you have to learn your craft and work at it.You might as well say that anyone can play the piano and that therefore there is no difference between a professional musician playing Chopin or Beethoven or Tchaikovsky and a child banging out 'Three Blind Mice.'I care passionately about poetry and believe me I rarely criticise other people's work and when I do I normally aspire to do so in a positive and constructive way.But that's when I'm commenting on LIVING poets whose work I see on here and who I want to encourage.Bukowski is dead and because he's (allegedly) a 'classic poet' he needs to be held to higher standards.For what it's worth I think even the greatest poets often wrote poor work and I've been quite open about my criticisms of it even when they're by writers who I'm genuinely enthusiastic about.And as for the idea that there's some kind of reader for whom a poem means something (as if the poet had written it just for THEM) well, I think that's a rather strange way of looking at it.But I can see that you belong to the school that believes that 'afflatus is all' and so it's obvious that you reject the very idea of critical standards outright.In your world anything goes.To me that's the philosophy of fascism and I hate and despise it.on Sep 06 2013 10:02 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Beautiful Garbage- I don't compare him to anyone because he is his own person, and writes his own way, he got a lot of bad news from critics but he still wrote what he wanted. And that's commendable. So what he had an ego? He didn't pretend to be anything that he wasn't. And he didn't write anything that he didn't believe, or went through. And truth be told I've never read any of those poets you named (except Lewis Carroll) and I am sure they are great writers, but like I said I don't compare any one writer to another, at least not in a bad way or to say one is better than the other. Sure many are better than others and certainly better than Bukowski but you obviously don't like Bukowski and that is your opinion, so we will agree to disagree there. And yes poetry is more than just how I described it, it is also how you described it, but the beauty of it is that we are free to write in whatever style we choose, and yes we can write a grocery list and call it poetry, but no matter how free the verse, even Bukowski's poem here it has some kind of form to it. even if you don't see it. And when I said sometimes only the author knows the true meaning, I mean also, if it has no meaning at all. We may see something there that isn't or we may not see what is.on Sep 06 2013 04:21 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Jeremy Ephe- I don't know if I am impressed as much with Bukowski's write as I am intrigued with all this misfortune that befell all these famous artists.

It's the kind of thing that you might start off writing and then you'd either work it up into a poem or bin it. Bukowski was a lazy writer who thought he could get away with posting any old crap. I've seen worse from him but he only occasionally IMO rises to the level of a proper poem.

Harrison- This poem aches with restrained vulnerability\u2014it\u2019s one of Bukowski\u2019s most haunting and human pieces. The bluebird becomes a symbol of tenderness buried beneath bravado, and the way he both protects and suppresses it is devastatingly relatable. \u201cWe sleep together like that / with our secret pact\u201d\u2014that quiet confession hits harder than any outburst could. There\u2019s such power in the things we hide to survive, especially when art and masculinity demand armor. This poem doesn\u2019t flinch, and that\u2019s what makes it unforgettable.

The metaphor of a cat waiting to jump on a bed creates a sense of impending doom. The speaker's regret and apology for his wife's impending loss are conveyed through his imagined interactions with her after his death. The poem also reveals the speaker's fear of being a burden and his desire for reconciliation.Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem is less characterized by vulgarity and more focused on intimacy and vulnerability. It reflects the poet's preoccupation with themes of mortality, love, and loss, common in his later period. The poem's simplicity and conversational tone contrast with the more experimental and abstract works of his earlier years. By using accessible language and imagery, Bukowski effectively conveys the raw emotions of a dying man's final thoughts and fears.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (55)5Good workLovelyWell writtenLike (55)Likes:brett masters,Sky Spirals,Bee.,Domhnaill,Reed Rosson,EOD,Misanthropus,Frauline,Rucha Dalvi,Khatia Tsiklauri, ,Un.expect.ed,Pen28,Terwilliger Time,FatMaestro,Blue-rekluse-000,Charlie6,Seven of Heaven,Alex Magrath,i2BR02B,Jesse Cabell,Lucemp,Rustedmetal,Richard Weissman,ChD,Bluebird74,Jyotsana Lalotra,Frogautumn48,dys4ia,Erin Cowart,James M.,Einar,Riadasimovg,TriinH,Cynthia Cardoso,ines jia,baranzbk,JC Rogers,Hats,Mark Andrus,Brian Peter Hodgkinson, ,zarref,Zachary Peters,Sammylovesmilfs69,Prefab-sprout,Leenikg,Jillian Moreno,Mczernievska,unknowing artist,Vardopoetry,Jay823,Elias17,Flying penguin7,Service dog,pastpayton,PemalelTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsFlying penguin7- Nicely writtenLiked iton Jul 10 2025 05:19 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserBrian Peter Hodgkinson- this is fabulousThankson Aug 12 2022 10:47 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerwilliger Time- how can you not like this.......Amazingon Mar 27 2021 02:11 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserBrett masters- great human feeling and frailtyon Jan 04 2020 05:33 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- From guest Andrea Suverato (contact)Awesome, in which book is this poem?

It stands in contrast to Bukowski's other works, which often delve into themes of alienation and despair. However, it aligns with the post-modern era's skepticism towards grand narratives and the commodification of art.The poem depicts the \"final curtain\" of a long-running musical, a symbol of society's obsession with entertainment. The speaker, who has not seen the musical, expresses disdain for the spectacle, equating it with the superficiality and emptiness of modern life. While the audience revels in the performance, the speaker remains isolated and untouched, emphasizing the disconnect between the individual and society's pursuit of pleasure.Despite his contempt for entertainment, the speaker acknowledges its utility in keeping people distracted and away from him. This suggests a degree of resignation, as the speaker finds solace in solitude rather than engaging with a society he finds distasteful. The poem thus reflects Bukowski's characteristic cynicism and his belief that true human connection is elusive in a world consumed by entertainment and self-indulgence.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (9)3InspiredAmazingWell writtenLike (9)Likes:Terry Collett,Sky Spirals,Justmore,sdfdfsd,Domhnaill,Terwilliger Time,Sockz,Flying penguin7,pastpaytonTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsFlying penguin7- Greatly pennedWell writtenon Jul 19 2025 08:37 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Great poemon Sep 10 2018 12:09 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- From guest stormy rockweather (contact)Leave me alone!

It conveys a sense of wasted potential, as the rose's failure to blossom during its appointed time implies a failure to seize life's opportunities. The personification of the sun as \"disgusted\" further emphasizes the sense of disappointment and missed chances. Unlike Bukowski's other works, which often explore themes of alienation and self-destruction, this poem takes a more introspective approach, focusing on the consequences of missed opportunities and the potential for regret. It reflects the disillusionment and sense of lost time that was prevalent during the post-World War II era.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (45)4Thank youI enjoyedGood workLike (45)Likes:Sky Spirals,Bee.,Justmore,sdfdfsd,Misanthropus, ,Joshua Sanders,Suleive, ,D.

The speaker declares their satisfaction with their life, contrasting it with the constant striving and dissatisfaction of others. The poem's tone is cynical and critical, particularly toward those who conform to societal pressures or seek validation from others.The poem's staccato rhythm and short lines emphasize the speaker's blunt and matter-of-fact tone. The use of colloquial language and imagery reinforces the poem's down-to-earth style. The poem's conclusion suggests that resilience, humor, and self-acceptance are key to survival, even in difficult times.Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem is relatively straightforward and lacks the explicit vulgarity or sexual themes common in his writing. It aligns with his broader themes of individuality, non-conformity, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (28)6Clever writeEnjoyed itEnjoyableLike (28)Likes:Terry Collett,Pi\u00f1ata Non Grata,Sky Spirals,Justmore,Domhnaill,Eli Sparrow,Pearlesque,Emma286,Papa Mama Jama,Pen28,Terwilliger Time,KittenPoetess,megziepoo2U85,Lucemp,Otyxtyx,Niister77,Luciano di Visco,Bluebird74,Jedlester,Jsaojose8,Caroline Maureen,Random Scribbler,ABarr,AnnW,Zach Camden,Annikasummer,cwtch,AbstractirlTo reply, click a comment.Random Scribbler- Wonderful write up!

The speaker observes a glass bauble, comparing it to a fragile egg and a clear tear. Within this bauble, time seems suspended, preserving moments from the past like a tapestry. The inhabitants of this bauble are described as light and busy, similar to other poems by the author that examine the domestic sphere. The poem contrasts this idyllic scene with the harsh reality of the present, where a woman is stranded in a barren landscape, her shadow a reminder of her past suffering. The poem ends with a sense of resignation, as the speaker acknowledges the inevitability of death and the passage of time.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (15)3Nice jobInspiringGood workLike (15)Likes:Skye Darkholme,Czanie,june panic,Emily9,Tide Conductor,Rwoytsek,Mind gypsy,Betsy O.

I picked it because after reading it, I had no clue what she was trying to say.Here is what I have come up with so far.I believe this is about the final moments of a woman in a hospital. Listed are some of the things I've made note of.  These are just my opinions though.1.) \"Flick the glass with your fingernail:It will ping like a Chinese chime in the slightest air stir\"I believe this refers to a needle, and some antidote in a glass bottle.  Nurses pluck the needle to make sure there's no air in it.2.)\"Though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer.The inhabitants are light as cork,Every one of them permanently busy.\"If you've been to a hospital, you know exactly what it's like.  Everyone is moving somewhere, doing something.3.)\"As Victorian cushions. This familyOf valentine faces might please a collector:They ring true, like good china.\"I interpretted this as being the worried family members of the patient in the hospital.4.)\"A woman is dragging her shadow in a circle\"When someone is down to their last moments in life, my guess is that they would be thinking about everything in the past, and the things they've done wrong, or their \"shadows.\"5.)\"And appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg.She lives quietly\"Blitzkrieg being a type of military warfare, this woman has endured enough of her own internal conflicts with herself, and now she's getting ready to experience the quiet after the storm.6.)\"She has one too many dimensions to enter.Grief and anger, exorcised,Leave her alone now.\"This is where the woman dies, and all of the fears and feelings she had been holding on to have left her now.7.)\"The future is a grey seagullTattling in its cat-voice of departure.Age and terror, like nurses, attend her,And a drowned man, complaining of the great cold,Crawls up out of the sea.\"The last lines sum up any kind of life-after-death scene, with the future being grey, and pretty much void.That's what I've made of it so far.

She doesn't need this, doesn't waste time on it.Now for the pure genius of her word play...again the theme of isolation and even a glass jar reference.  She is caged by her own SELF but is quite aware of the world of beauty that lies just outside her hospital door so-to-speak.

Plath's use of juxtaposition\u2014contrasting the sacred figures of the Nativity with the secular imagery of department store displays\u2014highlights the tension between religious devotion and consumerism.Compared to Plath's other works, \"A Winter's Tale\" is more explicitly political and less introspective. It reflects the disillusionment and alienation characteristic of her later period, which is evident in her novel \"The Bell Jar.\"The poem's setting in Boston, a historical and cultural hub, adds another layer of irony as the city's Puritan heritage clashes with the rampant consumerism depicted. Plath's use of local landmarks and businesses further grounds the poem in the time period.Overall, \"A Winter's Tale\" is a sharp and critical commentary on the societal pressures and materialism that can overshadow the true spirit of the holiday season. Its juxtaposition of sacred and secular imagery effectively conveys the sense of alienation and disillusionment that permeated the mid-20th century.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (5)0LovelyInspiredGood workLike (5)Sylvia PlathFollowBorn in 1932 to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem at the age of eight.

The speaker warns against dissecting a bird, flaying a beast, or plucking out a heart to understand their inner workings.The poem uses the metaphor of scientific dissection to represent the act of trying to understand something deeply. The speaker suggests that this process can be destructive, and that we may end up destroying the very thing we are trying to learn about.The imagery in the poem is graphic and unsettling, and the tone is one of warning. The speaker's voice is authoritative, and the poem's message is clear: we should be careful not to dissect and analyze things too much, lest we destroy them.This poem is similar to Plath's other works in its use of dark imagery and its exploration of themes of death and loss. It is also characteristic of her work in its use of metaphors and similes to create a vivid and evocative image.The poem is also reflective of the time period in which it was written. The middle of the 20th century saw a great deal of scientific and technological advancement, and there was a growing belief in the power of science to solve all of humanity's problems. However, Plath's poem suggests that there are some things that science cannot explain, and that we should be cautious about trying to dissect and analyze everything.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (66)7Enjoyed itFantasticGood workLike (66)Likes: ,Rissa C,D.

She is the deepest of deep. She goes where no man or women has ever gone before.on May 03 2007 03:34 PM PSTEditDelete- \"Admonition\" might not be in the style warming us to her going on at least celebrating an observation, but this is warning to just give the reader like a manual to not have a nullification of animals for a careless section, so an abbreviation that can lose its appreciation in the spreads, as said elsewhere .I needed someone to sit me down tonight and point out something, and Sylvia Plath had that way, with a no not nonsense but everything not straightened.  So, I think these are traits as well we can't be trist with by the straits. The first stanza has such delicate curtailing when getting something intact in isolation.  And such oxymoronic events are on the earth with macro, micro, and mucho macho ways but mankind will have understaning by siding to not be the monster of menace but take the startle of how we're jointed for good, eco and own.The second 4 lines go opposite from internal lovelies to externals but turns a stomach to hang that as a trophy of purpose of all to see only, like scalping personalities or literal taxidermists' results if empty acknowledgement went on the wall.The last is without riddle to not just do autopsy but empathy for some study with true eagerness of existence, as my daughter says lala-ha.on Mar 04 2007 05:57 PM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192-preposition-- Her flow seemed interrupted on the last line of each stanza, I didn't count the meter, but this seems an unsual write from dear plath...

The poem's detached tone and use of third-person observers underscore the dispassionate fascination that disasters evoke.Compared to Plath's other works, \"Aftermath\" is less confessional and more observational. It aligns with the broader post-World War II literary trend of exploring the psychological and social impact of trauma. The poem's use of impersonal language and lack of specific details suggest a collective experience of loss and detachment.The poem's brevity and understatement give it a powerful impact. Through its sparse imagery and measured language, \"Aftermath\" conveys the complex emotions of those who witness devastation, from initial curiosity to ultimate emptiness.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (11)2Clever writeInspiredLovelyLike (11)Likes:Skye Darkholme,ourladylazarus,Ken Doll,Rwoytsek,Hems9,Monica Ellis,D.

It begins with a sense of stasis and emptiness, but then bursts into a vibrant and visceral depiction of transformation and liberation. The speaker identifies with both Ariel, Shakespeare's ethereal spirit, and Godiva, the legendary naked horsewoman.The poem reflects Plath's exploration of themes such as female empowerment, the search for identity, and the struggle against societal constraints. It is characteristic of her confessional style, with its raw emotions and startling imagery. Compared to her earlier work, \"Ariel\" shows a departure from the more traditional forms and language of her debut collection, \"The Colossus.\" It is more experimental and fragmented, reflecting her evolving poetic style and the tumultuous period in which it was written.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (211)67Good job!Thank youWell writtenLike (211)Likes:Asad Mehmood,ozzylord,Leira,Sword of the Soul,Shiningexcavator,Eddard Grimpike,Soyam-29,Jonna,Floracaroline19,jaysxorbit, ,T.F.

There are references here to the Little Mermaid (the myth, not the Disney version), Lady Godiva, the Nix, the archangel Ariel (usually known as Uriel), the Rusalka and many other besides, as well as describing a horse ride which may or may not have happened in a dream.

Arial has a double meaning in this poem, as not only is she reffering to the god ariel, she is also writing about a horse that she owned which she named Ariel. This explains the linesThe brown arcOf the neck I cannot catch,as the horse is galloping away and she cannot stop it.

I don't know what exactly Sylvia had in mind when she wrote this, but to me it feels as if taking the name of this character, she gave it a new meaning as a poignant and bludgeoning spirit or entity that floats in the beginning of dawn, static and then hurls itself upon the morning, very well could be a distorted and imagery rich way to describe a simple sun rise, yet with taints of artermath or wrecked hopes, a shadow that seems to not even be broken by 'the cauldron of morning' as she wrote, and it only turns into 'The dw that flies, suicidal'. You would think of sunrise as gentle and delightful, yet she has painted it in a very rich and interesting atmosphere of distress as if waking up not from a nightmare, but waking to the morning's real nightmare after the numbing blackness of a nightsky. ~ Juan Anguason May 15 2004 06:39 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Bloodsucker Boss- More inenbriating goodness from everyone's favorite toxic genius.I am always amazed at Plath's pathogenic stanzas,plateauing and stalling on the edge between meaningless,cryptic wordplay and divine,pensive masterwork.This poem is a great example,shifting from something to substance with every other line,keeping you on the edge of you seat in anticipation of the cathartic climax that will never come.My favorite line:\"Eye, the cauldron of morning.\"on Sep 17 2003 07:46 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Sylvia PlathFollowBorn in 1932 to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem at the age of eight.

It depicts the protagonist sending back the key to a forbidden room, suggesting a rejection of male control and a reclamation of autonomy.The poem's brevity and repetition add weight to each word, emphasizing the protagonist's agency and the perceived threat of the \"study.\" The use of \"X-rayed\" and \"dissected\" evokes images of vulnerability and objectification, conveying the protagonist's fear of being consumed by the patriarchal figure.Compared to Plath's other works, \"Bluebeard\" exhibits similar themes of female victimization and resistance found in \"Daddy\" and \"Lady Lazarus.\" However, it differs in its focus on agency rather than victimhood, marking a shift towards a more empowered stance.The poem's context within the post-World War II era resonates with the evolving social norms and expectations surrounding gender roles. Plath's critique of male power and female submission reflects the shifting dynamics and the ongoing struggle for women's autonomy.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (12)0Lovely jobEnjoyableAmazingLike (12)Sylvia PlathFollowBorn in 1932 to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem at the age of eight.

The speaker expresses a desire to fill the child's gaze with beauty and wonder, symbolized by \"color\" and \"ducks,\" reflecting the transformative power of childhood. However, the poem also hints at the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead, as the \"troublous\" and \"dark\" aspects of the world begin to intrude upon the child's innocent perspective.Compared to Plath's other works, \"Child\" stands out for its relative lack of overt darkness and despair. While elements of her characteristic bleakness are present, the poem also conveys a sense of hope and potential. This is evident in the speaker's wish to provide the child with a world filled with beauty and meaning, even as she acknowledges the presence of adversity.In its portrayal of the complexities of motherhood, \"Child\" reflects the social and cultural norms of the time period in which it was written. The speaker's desire to shape and protect her child's vision of the world mirrors the prevailing belief that mothers had a significant role in molding the future character and well-being of their children. However, the poem also hints at the limitations of this role, as the child's path is ultimately shaped by both their own experiences and the broader social and environmental forces that surround them.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (28)5Clever jobGood workThanksLike (28)Likes:Skye Darkholme, ,Rachel Thomas37,The Tellurian,june panic,Ken Doll,Dreams-writer,Pseudopsycho.,I'm Offline,Reshmeeka,Ay, ,PigDemon17, ,Sweet Nostalgia,Paula Griffith,D.

They say that she would scrutinize her word choices and analyze her poems for quite some time. Knowing this, when I read her poety, I often wonder why she chose certain wordings and certain little bizarre things I find. I wonder why she chose to say \"eye\" instead of \"eyes,\" which seems much more logical.I hate the third line, it irks me to a great degree. I hate that she rhymes \"zoo\" with \"new.\" I don't know why. it just REALLY bothers me.This is a cute poem. I like it, but Ms. Plath was not known to write \"cute\" poems, and I definitely don't think it's her greatest. Nevertheless, not every amazing poet has to write an amazing poem every time she puts her pen to paper. It's very childlike, and I think that's what she was trying to portray.

The 3 quatrains of this sonnet are complex and seem to suggest an emotional context of guilt and anxiety amidst a physical setting of opulence. These 2 contexts correspond to the glitter and misery of Sylvia Plath's life.The tour de force couplet is far more powerful and immediate: the caustic ticking of the midnight clock indicates the climax of psychological agony that has been building all evening.Please write me if you are a Plath fan as well.Inspiredon Sep 01 2022 10:45 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Stephen76- The flagon with the dragon holds the brew that is true.on Aug 24 2022 07:52 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserKindel Sol- This is fire!

This is an earlier piece, and Ariel (and her novel The Bell Jar) are what she's best known for. Also, a definitive bio of Plath, Red Comet, just came out. It's more than 1,000 pages long, but worth it if she interests you.on Nov 08 2020 01:20 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserVince4- I'm intrigued by how many people here think Plath just wrote this.

(I was in high school and my tastes unformed.) Now I'm embarrassed. There's a classic text -- I think it's Understanding Poetry -- that actually devotes a chapter to defining bad poetry, and McKuen's is one example.on Dec 20 2020 02:27 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserIslandtime- Lol I don't even wanna think about what I watched/read/listened to in HS. Lewis Turco's poetry textbook (I think it's called \"An Introduction Through Writing\" but don't quote me) has a long section about Mckuen. On a more humble level, I have a parody posted in here called Poetry and Poetics 101.

The brief fairy tale, the ticking of the clock to represent the cruel hand of fate that time is ticking away. She is aware of the time.And the \"trance,\" she describes reveals how isolated she might have felt, in knowing she was aware of the clock and of her decline, yet others remained oblivious.on Jun 12 2005 03:41 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- This is one of her better poems in terms of imagery and use of imperfect rhyme in the last 2 stanzas to parallel the frenzied countdown to midnight and the anxiety she feels.  Maybe at one time Plath herself felt a little like Cinderella and the caustic ticking of the clock parallels her countdown to suicide.  I think of this as one of her better poems.on Jul 31 2004 01:29 PM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Attesa- I think of it as a loss of time. Like every fairy tale must end especially with the last line.

A sensitive person who tended to be a bit of a perfectionist she was what many would consider a model daughter and student - popular, a straight A student, always winning the best prizes. She won a scholarship to Smith College in 1950 and even then she had an enviable list of publications.

It compares love to a journey with a clear destination. The poet contrasts this with the uncertainty of the future, arguing that it is unwise to delay gratification.The poem's focus on youth and the transience of time is in line with the themes of other works by the author. It also reflects the social context of the time, when the Black Death had made people acutely aware of the fragility of life.The poem's simple structure and use of rhyme scheme make it easy to understand and remember. The language is also relatively straightforward, with few complex or obscure words. This makes it accessible to a wide range of readers.Overall, the poem's message about the importance of living in the present is timeless and relevant to readers of all generations.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1082)453Liked itWell writtenGood work!Like (1082)Likes:Michael Griffiths,fieldnotes,Flowers4santa,Marcella.k, ,Lenadrwilson,Young Learner,Stella B.,Eddard Grimpike,AthenaAlkidemos,Little paw,Unknownstudent,Tale,A.S.V., ,Uri Oto Osar,SoulSymphonies,Aeris Yong,Veromenvil, ,Emmaa120933,Dedfish,Shadesofcool2009,Millionmiles,Lothl\u00f3rien -Lauren,thebluelagoon,Overthemoon5,Leachim,Julian7, ,Kallon,Perfect-Evil008,R.McF,Messiah taiwo,Pattis50, ,Mychelle,azraelg,zains812,Whispering Slowly,Jojojoking,Cornerwriter,Loreto,Warmcookies,Cecelia Blight,Levi-Ackerman,Chesa liwayway,Jenna Carpenter,Maca.T.a.,Izy, ,Nic984,Thyselfbetrue,thegirlnextdoor.,BIM2,Cadie,Devesh425,Idreaminlofi,pastpayton,Ayusp,inaganlu,Alice26,Jiller, ,K0k0r0,mandanamoon,RustAndRuin,Lilireinhart25,Bruisedviolet,Sylvia337To reply, click a comment.\u2190 Previous12345Next \u2192All at once\u2022Older commentsJDArt24- Love, such a beautiful invention. thanks for sharing.on Sep 27 2025 03:20 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTila- Captured romanticallyon Sep 17 2025 03:20 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserThelordreigns- AI leaves out so much and is really not appropriate for poetry analysis!

It is however a question of faith at all times... One must always justify the value of freedom with the value of responsibility... If two lovers are at polar odds with that value then their opposing odd will only grow stronger in that value until they either accept the responsibility or run away.... Everyone has dreams.... fantasies of a character they act out to become... if the world does not accept it within the faithful time that you spend improving it.... Choose responsibility... But never also forget to choose happiness... even in the struggles of all bad things... choose to see beauty and never ever give up finding warmth in the company of others...

Love the rhyming. DeborahAmazing.on Sep 27 2020 05:32 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMegabob- This is very definitely not a sonnet. Although Shakespeare is famous for his sonnets. it should be noted that a sonnet is a very restrictive form. there are two types of sonnets. a Petrarchan or Italian Sonnet, which came first or a Shakespearean or English sonnet which came second. The English sonnet as you can guess is closely associated with Shakespeare as he pioneered their use. a sonnet is and always was a 14 line poem, no more, no less. additionally both variants of the sonnet use Iambic pentameter. An Iamb being an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one. there should be 5 iambs precisely per line resulting in ten syllables per line with the same stress pattern through out. the Sonnets start to differ at the Rhyme scheme which is also strictly set. A Petrarchan Sonnet has a Rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDEor at timesABBA ABBA CDC DCDas you can see, the Italian Sonnet is split into an octave and a sestet.the English sonnet, which I personally are more familiar with, has a Rhyme scheme of:ABAB CDCD EFEF GGThis form also usually possesses a twist, or a Volta. usually located at the start of the third stanza. This twist could be a resolution to a problem presented in the previous lines or some other things. The line for this reason usually starts with a \"but\". the other thing to note about an English sonnet is the function of the ending couplet. The ending couplet should serve to sum up the poem in a concise way and tie off the entire thing.due to its strict and demanding form, a Sonnet is a very interesting writing exercise to improve your writing, even if you don't prefer the style. There are arguments about Sonnets as a form growing more lax over the years, but rest assured that this poem, is most definitely not a sonnet.Thank you for coming to my ted talk. and congratulations if you read all the way.on Nov 12 2020 08:28 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Agrt- Excellent summation - however, you answered your own answer.

He realizes that Cesario is not only a girl but has a twin brother. \r\n\r\n\"Journey's end in lovers' meeting/Every wise man's son doth know.\" is indicating that once they all find who it is they love that the journey will be done but that Cesario (Viola) knows this because she is constantly referring to herself as a man throughout the play. This just helps to cover it up more.\r\n\r\nThis song is also more of a joke because everyone takes Feste as a big joke but he is the only one who doesn't change who he is for anyone else.

The speaker remembers the pain of losing loved ones and regrets the time wasted on past mistakes. However, when the speaker remembers their cherished friend, it brings a sense of comfort.This poem differs from Shakespeare's other works, such as his sonnets, which often focus on romantic love and beauty. Instead, \"Dear Friend\" explores the complex emotions of loss and remembrance. It also aligns with the themes of melancholy and the passage of time prevalent in the Elizabethan era.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (12)1Lovely!Nicely doneEnjoyed itLike (12)Likes:The Tellurian, ,Museum of Anhedonia,Pokee,D.

The speaker's wish to be \"laid\" in \"sad cypres\" and their shroud \"stuck all with yew\" symbolizes mourning and sorrow. They also reject flowers and friends at their grave, seeking isolation and the avoidance of sympathy. The poem's brevity and repetitive language convey the speaker's intense grief and desperation, while the absence of hope and comfort reflects the despair and desolation of unrequited love. In comparison to Shakespeare's other works, this poem displays a concise and somber tone, lacking the complexity and grandeur of his plays and sonnets.

Orsino is suffering from pangs of love and is questioning Viola who he believes to be a boy. He wants to hear a sad love song he has heard the night before and is told it was sung by the clown Feste, who is of Olivia's household. Feste is sent for and as requested sings the song and is then paid by Orsino.The song is deliberately melancholy and nostalgic to match and reflect Orsino's mood at this point.on May 29 2004 12:02 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Ahkam- \"COME away, come away, death,And in sad cypres let me be laid;Fly away, fly away, breath;I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\"this is the job of a really talented poet that like a saint he always welcome the death ____ not considering that the only solution of his problems or any sort of escape but to compare the feelings of death with the sweet pain of Love.This is wonderful.on Feb 21 2004 09:33 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Philophant- Dark, but lovely.

It exhorts the reader to cast aside their fears, as all worldly possessions and pursuits are ultimately transient. The poem's simple yet powerful language conveys the universality of death, which affects all individuals, regardless of their status or station in life.The poem's structure consists of four stanzas, each of which begins with the refrain \"Fear no more.\" This repetition emphasizes the inevitability of death and the futility of dwelling on worldly concerns. The imagery of \"golden lads and girls\" and \"chimney-sweepers\" highlights the leveling effect of death, reducing everyone to dust.The poem's themes also resonate with the Elizabethan era's preoccupation with mortality and the transience of life. The poem's somber tone and themes of mortality align with the cultural attitudes of the time period.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (5)3Lovely poemWell writtenGood workLike (5)Likes:D. M.

Shakespeare uses simple and straightforward language, yet the words are full of meaning and emotion. The speaker, Mark Antony, uses repetition and rhetorical questions to build momentum and persuade the crowd to his point of view.The poem is similar to other works by Shakespeare in its use of blank verse and its exploration of complex themes such as ambition, loyalty, and the nature of good and evil. However, this speech is unique in its direct address to the audience and its use of irony and sarcasm.The poem is a reflection of the turbulent political climate of Shakespeare's time. It is a reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of reason and compassion.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (14)4GreatInspiringLovelyLike (14)Likes:Terry Collett,Natureobazee,Treeofknowing,Bethifer,Bliss5,Korallen Lang,Johan Regan,M.V.Tanner,D.

The lines explore themes of beauty, desire, and violence through rich imagery and symbolism. Each part of Lucrece's body becomes a metaphor for her vulnerability. Her hand, once a symbol of modesty, now covers her face, suggesting both shame and defiance. Her eyes, \"like marigolds,\" are closed in sleep, like flowers that have withdrawn from the world.Tarquin's lust is likened to a predator's hunger, while Lucrece becomes his prey. The poem's language is both sensual and brutal, reflecting the conflicting emotions at play. The description of Lucrece's physical beauty contrasts sharply with the violence and terror she experiences. The lines also highlight the power dynamics between men and women in the time period, as Lucrece's vulnerability is used to justify Tarquin's actions. Compared to Shakespeare's other works, this excerpt shares the themes of desire, power, and the consequences of violence, exploring them through a different lens of sexual assault and its aftermath.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)1FantasticGreatInspiredLike (2)Likes:Terry Collett,CasuarinaTerry Collett- Great poemon Feb 01 2020 08:00 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserWilliam ShakespeareFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By William Shakespeare2.3k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by William ShakespeareList all \u00bbSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting (Hamlet Act V, Scene II)521Sweet-and-twenty16Dear Friend112Love620From Venus And Adonis13When That I Was And A Little Tiny Boy24The Blossom22Helen's Soliloqy (All's Well That Ends Well)15Now The Hungry Lion Roars28Macbeth - Three witches casting a spell611Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow525Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears414Some Say That Ever \u2018Gainst That Season Comes (Hamlet, Act I, Scene I)27The Canakin Clink Pub Song (From 'Othello')12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326602-From-The-Rape-Of-Lucrece-by-William-Shakespeare"}

The angels, guardians of the child's innocence, watch over her bedside. The mention of \"God's laughing in Heaven\" and the \"Sailing Seven\" symbolize divine protection and happiness. However, the mother expresses a bittersweet note, acknowledging that the child's growth and independence will bring both joy and the inevitable separation from her.Compared to Yeats's other works, this poem is devoid of his typical themes of Irish mythology and Irish nationalism. Instead, it focuses on the universal and timeless experience of a mother's love. It reflects the sentimentality and gentleness found in many lullabies, aligning with the Victorian era's emphasis on domesticity and family values.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (11)6Good postLovelyNicely pennedLike (11)Likes: ,DuskenFae,Morgan Mahira,K.T.

Indeed, in poems from the latter half of his career, Classical mythology appears far more often than Irish. I'm also unsure as to why you think it's a 'mother's love' being expressed here. I'm a father and the sentiments are ones that I often feel.At the time he wrote this poem, Yeats was deeply immersed in the work of William Blake and it's not difficult to see the influence of both Blake's cradle poems from 'Songs of Innocence and Experience'.on Aug 06 2024 02:54 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Ilia Salari- Lovely poem.on Jan 27 2023 04:09 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserPeyrbupp77899- timeles beautyAmazingon Apr 21 2021 02:36 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- eitul elegaon Sep 13 2019 05:19 AM PSTEditDeleteAlesana The Band- Beautiful.on Feb 22 2014 06:21 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserGpnbuddy- Yeats wrote this for me to give to my grandson.on Apr 11 2011 02:15 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserComments from the archive\u2190 Previous12Next \u2192- ...there is no sadness here at all.

This is a seven star star-cluster in the constellation Taurus.  In Ancient Greece the stars in this star group were named after the seven daughters of Atlas.  The name Pleiades most likely comes from Ancient Greek mariners, because in the Mediterranean, these stars are most visable during the seven sailing months.

I like Yeats' last poems best, the ones he wrote when he was older or just before his death. While his earlier poems are certainly excellent, with a lifetime of experience to draw on, he only managed to become a master of poetry later in life. Poems like this, retrospective and contemplative, serve an important purpose in allowing readers with years less of experience in life to understand how things might change as they grow older.on Mar 24 2004 07:19 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Unbridled1- I find this piece to be very interesting and also quite sad.

Cummings' unconventional style, with its lowercase letters and unconventional punctuation, creates a sense of fragmentation and disruption. This reflects the transience and fragility of life, as the leaf, once vibrant and full of life, now falls to the ground. The stark contrast between the blackness of the leaf and the whiteness of the sky emphasizes the poem's central theme of death and loss. Compared to Cummings' other works, this poem exhibits a similar focus on mortality and the passage of time. However, its brevity and simplicity give it a distinct intensity that makes it particularly memorable. In the context of its time period, the poem's themes of transience and loss resonate with the disillusionment and uncertainty that characterized post-World War I society.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)2GreatEnjoyed itInspiringLike (7)Likes:Zai Luna Fortuna,nitr,Timothy P.

It's too vague for me to be sure of interpretations like the one given by PetrifiedAfforded. And I dislike choosing my own meaning for poetry.

Oh, I already commented on this.  Okay.on Apr 07 2005 02:25 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserAngelofcleansheets- Cummings is soooooo amazing.  I am so in love with him.  He is a genius.  I hate when people say he was just lazy.  They act like his poetry means nothing.  Whether or not he was lazy, it gave his poetry a very intricate, noticeable style.  His words are beautiful.  And I love the placement of the words.  Sometimes I find that they can be read more than one way.  It's awesome.This is just another example of his genius.Go Cummings!!!!on Mar 20 2005 09:49 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- I love how e. e. cummings throws all of the rules out the window and manages to pull it off. He manipulates grammar and puncuation in a way that makes a greater impact on the reader than most poems that follow a set form or pattern.on Mar 11 2005 11:19 AM PSTEditDeleteChicaneryInc- I'm sorry to say that where the punctuation is no joke at all. When I first looked at a Cumming's piece, I could have thought the same. However, Cumming's style is like this. He's the only poet in history to be able to write like this- it's harder than you believe. He uses broken up words to show emotion. You can't look at a Cumming's poem half the time and approach it in an intellectual manner- it's mostly emotion, or to deal with the minds eye. If you try and decode this poem, you ruin it.To be honest, if you think about it, I think this is about a storm coming into land. Black against the white sky.Black being storm clouds against a sky covered in white clouds.Chelliexoxoon Feb 21 2005 01:35 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Novae- The structure reminds me of blowing in the wind, broken and confused... maybe this is what it means?on Dec 05 2004 08:48 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTouchof1der- Thisis not my most favorite style of writing.

It seems that, as a poet, I'm always being told to follow the rules.  Maybe that's because only the best are allowed to break them, and in that case, ee would be one of the best.  I like the author's creativity, I think it's inspiring.  The meaning of this piece is really open to interpretation,  I think that the picture of a single leaf whirling to the ground is one we can all draw our own emotions from.

The reason I believe it did was because he could care less what others thought of it. Either take it or accept it. That is what I gather from reading his biblography, and interviews.The poem was twisted and metaphor. The scene he potrayed in here was to me dark and dead. Awesome job e.e.on May 14 2004 08:03 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- i think the strategically placed punctuation makes the poem kinetic, it almost appears to move as the leaf falling would. the final line, \".g\" ends the poem abruptly, as the twirling leaf would reach the ground. i think the black against white sky is the dead trees in winter, the cold scene also gives it a feeling of closure as the leaf reaches its destination, like the end of death.on Apr 14 2004 10:21 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Ofrosesandhello- i dont think this is a joke, really.

The speaker's imagination contrasts with the mundane actions of others, creating a sense of alienation. The reference to the Messiah emphasizes the significance of the event, yet the animals' indifference suggests a lack of understanding or appreciation. The \"sharp angels\" with \"faces like Jim Europe\" could represent messengers or witnesses, but their presence in the darkness evokes uncertainty and mystery. Compared to the author's other works, this poem stands out for its concise and fragmented style, reflecting the fragmented and introspective nature of the speaker's thoughts. It reflects the modernist era's preoccupation with isolation and alienation, as well as the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent world.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)1Good workGreat!Good workLike (1)Tip:  Summarize the story & your reactionLearn commentingLikes:nitr,HydradariqhyOlder commentsComments from the archiveNovae- His poems are alwyas so rambling, in the good way, like we're interrupting him in the middle of a lecture.

It depicts a solitary, introspective figure, possibly a reflection of the poet himself, who questions their actions and fears the consequences of society's judgment. The poem's brevity and fragmented lines convey a sense of isolation and desperation, as the speaker grapples with their own mortality. Compared to cummings' earlier works, such as \"Buffalo Bill's,\" which celebrate the American spirit, \"Me up at does\" exhibits a darker, more introspective tone, reflecting the disillusionment and skepticism prevalent during the interwar period.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)2GreatThank youLovelyLike (7)Likes:nitr,Caiden jackson,AirMuffin2001,Oragedude,Paul Preston,AAPoet7,myacereporter,MelkaniabhijeeOlder commentsOragedude- bruh i dont get this, rip. wait ayyyy lmao i get it. liton Mar 06 2019 01:59 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserAirMuffin2001- This means that the rat is poisoned by the human and the mouse was looking for food because he wanted to live.on Mar 06 2019 09:35 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserComments from the archiveLadie Lee- Exactly.on Jul 22 2005 04:28 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTouchof1der- It's amazing how profound this man can be in such a small amount of space and using such a minimal amount of words.

The speaker personifies silence as \"the blood whose flesh / is singing\" and then \"unsinging,\" suggesting a tension between life and death. The contrast between the vibrant \"april\" and the barren \"autumn\" emphasizes the bleakness of the winter landscape.The speaker's desire for \"terrible anonymity\" and the \"murdering minus of cold\" reflects a longing for escape from the pain of existence. The violent imagery of \"millionary knives of wind\" and \"scatter his nothing\" conveys the destructive force of nature and the vulnerability of the individual.The poem's unusual capitalization and punctuation create a sense of fragmentation and disorientation, reflecting the speaker's state of mind. The final lines offer a glimmer of hope, as \"gently\" and \"absolute peace\" suggest a potential resolution or transcendence. Overall, the poem captures the existential angst and longing for oblivion characteristic of early 20th-century modernism, while employing innovative language and imagery to create a unique and haunting experience.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)0I enjoyedGood shareFantasticLike (1)e.e. cummingsFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By e.e. cummings1.9k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by e.e. cummingsList all \u00bbplato told36why must itself up every of a park26Chansons Innocentes: I1The Eagle18ygUDuh718next to of course god america i824from tulips and chimneys12Seeker Of Truth05i carry your heart with me124509i like my body when it is with your152690may i feel said he124356maggie and milly and molly and may96302l(a...

The speaker initially expresses annoyance with the bird's constant singing, but later acknowledges his own fault and the beauty of the song. This change of perspective suggests a reconciliation between human and natural worlds.The poem's simplicity and direct language contrast with the complexity of its themes. The use of short, declarative sentences creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The conversational tone draws the reader into the speaker's inner struggle.Compared to Frost's other works, \"A Minor Bird\" is less overtly symbolic and more focused on personal experience. It reflects the prevailing themes of nature and self-awareness in Frost's poetry. The poem's brevity and clarity make it accessible to a wide range of readers.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (61)17Enjoyed it!FantasticEnjoyed itLike (61)Likes:RobertRichard,waydownuponjoy,Terry Collett,DianeAH,forever thinking,brett masters,Zai Luna Fortuna, ,R\u00e2\u0113le la-lune,L Spirit,lola lawal,Joe Fettig,Vaishkhushi,William Pencraft,Temi Cotek,menace to linear time,DarkLadybug, ,Ashany,Nick Esposito,Un.expect.ed,IntoxicatedLover,Jordano,Papolyt,Familiar12,alchemy s march, ,Shakil,Sounak Sinha,Kevin Kuepfer, ,Messypalette,Richard Reed, ,digitalgrandpa,Mani Mohan Ojha,Cardigan Fitz,Bhaskar Mukharjee,DaisiesAndFae, ,Orkida Muca,Eclipse MacTagge,Bellsnoel,Fallgreen84,Seipher38,Harvey'oLewiathans,Raven Spirit,Ken Doll,M.

And I begin to fear they never will. All they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered. Nearer in plight their neighbors are than distance.SMOKE- I am the guardian wraith of starlit smoke that leans out this and that way from their chimney. I will not have their happiness despaired of.MIST- No one - not I would give them up for lost simply because they don't know where they are. \u00a0I am the damper counterpart of smoke that gives off from a garden ground at night. But lifts no higher than a garden grows. I cotton to their landscape. That's who I am. I am no further from their fate than you areSMOKE- They must by now have learned the native tongue. Why don't they ask the red man where they are?MIST - They often do, and none the wiser for it. So do they also ask philosophers who come to look in on them from the pulpit. They will ask anyone there is to ask - In the fond faith accumulated fact - will of itself take fireand light the world up. Learning has been a part of theirreligion.SMOKE - If the day ever comes when they know who they are, they may know better where they are. But who they are is too much to believe - either for them or the onlooking world. They are too sudden to be credible.MIST - Listen, they murmur talking in the dark on whatshould be their daylong theme continued. Putting the lamp out has not put their thought out.

Mist expresses doubt about the sleepers' awareness of their surroundings and their place in the world. Smoke, on the other hand, insists on their resilience and the potential for enlightenment.The poem reflects Frost's preoccupation with isolation and the search for self-knowledge. Compared to his other works, it shares themes of uncertainty and human limitations. However, it also incorporates a philosophical dimension, exploring the nature of reality and the relationship between inner and outer worlds.The conversation between Mist and Smoke suggests a perpetual cycle of questioning and searching. The sleepers represent the human condition, striving for knowledge and an understanding of their existence. The poem's use of personification and imagery creates a dreamlike atmosphere, blurring the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical.Moreover, the poem comments on the limitations of conventional learning and the pursuit of external validation. Mist and Smoke suggest that true enlightenment comes from within, through introspection and a connection with nature. The ending leaves a sense of mystery and unresolved questions, mirroring the ongoing nature of our own existential journey.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (6)5LovelyWell writtenThank you!Like (6)Translated by Jose Domingo GarciaLikes:Terry Collett, ,Amy Elizabeth Stares,Ken Doll,CBRussell,KindPoetTo reply, click a comment.- kudosNicely done!on Dec 30 2018 10:18 PM PSTEditDeleteAmy Elizabeth Stares- Killed it !on Sep 16 2018 10:04 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Very good workon Apr 20 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poem and themeon Oct 26 2018 12:05 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poemon Aug 02 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Fine poemClever jobon Jul 17 2018 12:25 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poemon Jul 03 2018 12:26 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Classic poemon May 13 2018 12:04 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserNana Penn- Inspired!Simple, yet complex.\u00a0 Love Robert Frosts poetry/Summarize the story:\u00a0 They must by now have learned the native tongue.

You rememberYou said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,The early Mormons made a settlementAnd built a stone baptismal font outdoors-But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountainTo go West to a worse fight with the desert.You said you'd seen the stone baptismal font.Well, take me there.'Someday I will.''Today.''Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?Let's talk about it.''Let's go see the place.''To shut you up I'll tell you what I'll do:I'll find that fountain if it takes all summer,And both of our united strengths, to do it.''You've lost it, then?''Not so but I can find it.No doubt it's grown up some to woods around it.The mountain may have shifted since I saw itIn eighty-five.''As long ago as that?''If I remember rightly, it had sprungA leak and emptied then. And forty yearsCan do a good deal to bad masonry.You won't see any Mormon swimming in it.But you have said it, and we're off to find it.Old as I am, I'm going to let myselfBe dragged by you all over everywhere- ''I thought you were a guide.''I am a guide,And that's why I can't decently refuse you.'We made a day of it out of the world,Ascending to descend to reascend.The old man seriously took his bearings,And spoke his doubts in every open place.We came out on a look-off where we facedA cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,Or stained by vegetation from above,A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.'Well, if I haven't brought you to the fountain,At least I've brought you to the famous Bottle.''I won't accept the substitute. It's empty.''So's everything.''I want my fountain.''I guess you'd find the fountain just as empty.And anyway this tells me where I am.''Hadn't you long suspected where you were?''You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?Look here, you treat your guide with due respectIf you don't want to spend the night outdoors.I vow we must be near the place from whereThe two converging slides, the avalanches,On Marshall, look like donkey's ears.We may as well see that and save the day.''Don't donkey's ears suggest we shake our own?''For God's sake, aren't you fond of viewing nature?You don't like nature. All you like is books.What signify a donkey's cars and bottle,However natural? Give you your books!Well then, right here is where I show you books.Come straight down off this mountain just as fastAs we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.It's hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.'Be ready, I thought, for almost anything.We struck a road I didn't recognize,But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoesIn dust once more. We followed this a mile,Perhaps, to where it ended at a houseI didn't know was there. It was the kindTo bring me to for broad-board paneling.I never saw so good a house deserted.'Excuse me if I ask you in a windowThat happens to be broken, Davis said.'The outside doors as yet have held against us.I want to introduce you to the peopleWho used to live here. They were Robinsons.You must have heard of Clara Robinson,The poetess who wrote the book of versesAnd had it published. It was all aboutThe posies on her inner windowsill,And the birds on her outer windowsill,And how she tended both, or had them tended:She never tended anything herself.She was 'shut in' for life. She lived her wholeLife long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.I'll show You how she had her sills extendedTo entertain the birds and hold the flowers.Our business first's up attic with her books.'We trod uncomfortably on crunching glassThrough a house stripped of everythingExcept, it seemed, the poetess's poems.Books, I should say!- if books are what is needed.A whole edition in a packing caseThat, overflowing like a horn of plenty,Or like the poetess's heart of love,Had spilled them near the window, toward the lightWhere driven rain had wet and swollen them.Enough to stock a village library-Unfortunately all of one kind, though.They bad been brought home from some publisherAnd taken thus into the family.Boys and bad hunters had known what to doWith stone and lead to unprotected glass:Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?By being invisible for what it was,Or else by some remoteness that defied themTo find out what to do to hurt a poem.Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,To send it sailing out the attic windowTill it caught wind and, opening out its covers,Tried to improve on sailing like a tileBy flying like a bird (silent in flight,But all the burden of its body song),Only to tumble like a stricken bird,And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.Books were not thrown irreverently about.They simply lay where someone now and then,Having tried one, had dropped it at his feetAnd left it lying where it fell rejected.Here were all those the poetess's lifeHad been too short to sell or give away.'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.'Why not take two or three?''Take all you want.'Good-looking books like that.' He picked one freshIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.He read in one and I read in another,Both either looking for or finding something.The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.I was soon satisfied for the time being.All the way home I kept rememberingThe small book in my pocket. It was there.The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heavenAt having eased her heart of one more copy-Legitimately. My demand upon her,Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.In time she would be rid of all her books.\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):In \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books,\" Robert Frost weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature. The poem's protagonist embarks on a journey to rediscover a long-lost fountain, but his quest ultimately leads him to a profound encounter with the written word.Like many of Frost's other works, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is characterized by its vivid imagery and deceptively simple language. The poem's opening lines establish a sense of anticipation and wonder as the speaker learns of a mysterious mountain that holds promise of great fortune. However, as the journey progresses, the speaker's hopes are gradually dashed, and he is confronted with the harsh realities of time and change.The poem's central metaphor, the fountain, serves as a powerful symbol of the protagonist's longing for connection and meaning in life. Like the mythical Fountain of Youth, the fountain represents a desire to escape the limitations of time and find renewal. However, just as the protagonist's physical search for the fountain proves futile, so too does his search for spiritual fulfillment in the external world.Ultimately, it is through his encounter with the poetess Clara Robinson's books that the protagonist finds a sense of solace and purpose. The books become a metaphor for the power of literature to transcend the boundaries of time and provide a window into the human experience. Frost's portrayal of the poetess's \"shut in for life\" condition suggests the transformative power of art to liberate the spirit even in the face of physical limitations.In its exploration of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is a characteristically complex and moving poem by Robert Frost. Like many of his other works, it invites multiple readings and challenges the reader to confront the essential questions of life and meaning.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)1Enjoyed itEnjoyed itGreatLike (1)Likes:Terry CollettTerry Collett- Engaging poemon Sep 26 2019 08:23 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRobert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost2.3k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326555-A-Fountain--a-Bottle--a-Donkey-s-Ears--and-Some-Books-by-Robert-Frost"}

The angels, guardians of the child's innocence, watch over her bedside. The mention of \"God's laughing in Heaven\" and the \"Sailing Seven\" symbolize divine protection and happiness. However, the mother expresses a bittersweet note, acknowledging that the child's growth and independence will bring both joy and the inevitable separation from her.Compared to Yeats's other works, this poem is devoid of his typical themes of Irish mythology and Irish nationalism. Instead, it focuses on the universal and timeless experience of a mother's love. It reflects the sentimentality and gentleness found in many lullabies, aligning with the Victorian era's emphasis on domesticity and family values.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (11)6Good postLovelyNicely pennedLike (11)Likes: ,DuskenFae,Morgan Mahira,K.T.

Indeed, in poems from the latter half of his career, Classical mythology appears far more often than Irish. I'm also unsure as to why you think it's a 'mother's love' being expressed here. I'm a father and the sentiments are ones that I often feel.At the time he wrote this poem, Yeats was deeply immersed in the work of William Blake and it's not difficult to see the influence of both Blake's cradle poems from 'Songs of Innocence and Experience'.on Aug 06 2024 02:54 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Ilia Salari- Lovely poem.on Jan 27 2023 04:09 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserPeyrbupp77899- timeles beautyAmazingon Apr 21 2021 02:36 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- eitul elegaon Sep 13 2019 05:19 AM PSTEditDeleteAlesana The Band- Beautiful.on Feb 22 2014 06:21 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserGpnbuddy- Yeats wrote this for me to give to my grandson.on Apr 11 2011 02:15 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserComments from the archive\u2190 Previous12Next \u2192- ...there is no sadness here at all.

I don't agree that the poet is feeling sad that he won't see the child grow - he is feeling sad that the child must grow and change.

In this collection the last stanza is \"I kiss you and kiss you, My pigeon, my own.  Ah! How I shall miss you When you are grown.\"  Is this a change from the original or vice-versa?Either way, this is a lovely poem.MOD MESSAGEThe words of this poem have been checked with many printed texts and all appear to match the words shown here.Alas many singers have modified Yeats' work to fit their own composition.

This is a seven star star-cluster in the constellation Taurus.  In Ancient Greece the stars in this star group were named after the seven daughters of Atlas.  The name Pleiades most likely comes from Ancient Greek mariners, because in the Mediterranean, these stars are most visable during the seven sailing months.

I like Yeats' last poems best, the ones he wrote when he was older or just before his death. While his earlier poems are certainly excellent, with a lifetime of experience to draw on, he only managed to become a master of poetry later in life. Poems like this, retrospective and contemplative, serve an important purpose in allowing readers with years less of experience in life to understand how things might change as they grow older.on Mar 24 2004 07:19 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Unbridled1- I find this piece to be very interesting and also quite sad.

Cummings' unconventional style, with its lowercase letters and unconventional punctuation, creates a sense of fragmentation and disruption. This reflects the transience and fragility of life, as the leaf, once vibrant and full of life, now falls to the ground. The stark contrast between the blackness of the leaf and the whiteness of the sky emphasizes the poem's central theme of death and loss. Compared to Cummings' other works, this poem exhibits a similar focus on mortality and the passage of time. However, its brevity and simplicity give it a distinct intensity that makes it particularly memorable. In the context of its time period, the poem's themes of transience and loss resonate with the disillusionment and uncertainty that characterized post-World War I society.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)2GreatEnjoyed itInspiringLike (7)Likes:Zai Luna Fortuna,nitr,Timothy P.

I don't think its a joke, but I don't find it displays any sort of recognizable genius. Seems to me he's just having fun fooling around. To Chellie - of course his poetry means something - but we'll have to choose our own meaning, won't we? And if we influence the meaning (by choosing it) it won't really be genius anymore. It's too vague for me to be sure of interpretations like the one given by PetrifiedAfforded. And I dislike choosing my own meaning for poetry. Means that I'm basically coloring in the lines with my own experiences, my own meaning, which doesn't sit right with me. Its his poem. His experiences. Suppose we're all getting it wrong? He could've colored it differently, after all. 0_o this turned into a rant. sorry bout that.on Apr 17 2009 11:27 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- with a splotch of a splash this is announcing while affirming \"!blac\"\"k\"settlement timeyet drown in your denim moment as there's a curtaining of nature that's \"agains\"feel the s ringsand the booming halted as \"t\" --its own tonestretchwhile intermitentently there's a \"(whi)\", an eyeyeball opens the question of lightening speedtowards my favorite line, \"te sky\"/the tellurium of it as earth is under it, the THE without the h of hot staying.

I hate when people say he was just lazy.  They act like his poetry means nothing.  Whether or not he was lazy, it gave his poetry a very intricate, noticeable style.  His words are beautiful.  And I love the placement of the words.  Sometimes I find that they can be read more than one way.  It's awesome.This is just another example of his genius.Go Cummings!!!!on Mar 20 2005 09:49 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- I love how e. e. cummings throws all of the rules out the window and manages to pull it off. He manipulates grammar and puncuation in a way that makes a greater impact on the reader than most poems that follow a set form or pattern.on Mar 11 2005 11:19 AM PSTEditDeleteChicaneryInc- I'm sorry to say that where the punctuation is no joke at all. When I first looked at a Cumming's piece, I could have thought the same. However, Cumming's style is like this. He's the only poet in history to be able to write like this- it's harder than you believe. He uses broken up words to show emotion. You can't look at a Cumming's poem half the time and approach it in an intellectual manner- it's mostly emotion, or to deal with the minds eye. If you try and decode this poem, you ruin it.To be honest, if you think about it, I think this is about a storm coming into land. Black against the white sky.Black being storm clouds against a sky covered in white clouds.Chelliexoxoon Feb 21 2005 01:35 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Novae- The structure reminds me of blowing in the wind, broken and confused... maybe this is what it means?on Dec 05 2004 08:48 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTouchof1der- Thisis not my most favorite style of writing.

It seems that, as a poet, I'm always being told to follow the rules.  Maybe that's because only the best are allowed to break them, and in that case, ee would be one of the best.  I like the author's creativity, I think it's inspiring.  The meaning of this piece is really open to interpretation,  I think that the picture of a single leaf whirling to the ground is one we can all draw our own emotions from.

The reason I believe it did was because he could care less what others thought of it. Either take it or accept it. That is what I gather from reading his biblography, and interviews.The poem was twisted and metaphor. The scene he potrayed in here was to me dark and dead. Awesome job e.e.on May 14 2004 08:03 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192- i think the strategically placed punctuation makes the poem kinetic, it almost appears to move as the leaf falling would. the final line, \".g\" ends the poem abruptly, as the twirling leaf would reach the ground. i think the black against white sky is the dead trees in winter, the cold scene also gives it a feeling of closure as the leaf reaches its destination, like the end of death.on Apr 14 2004 10:21 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Ofrosesandhello- i dont think this is a joke, really.

The speaker's imagination contrasts with the mundane actions of others, creating a sense of alienation. The reference to the Messiah emphasizes the significance of the event, yet the animals' indifference suggests a lack of understanding or appreciation. The \"sharp angels\" with \"faces like Jim Europe\" could represent messengers or witnesses, but their presence in the darkness evokes uncertainty and mystery. Compared to the author's other works, this poem stands out for its concise and fragmented style, reflecting the fragmented and introspective nature of the speaker's thoughts.

It depicts a solitary, introspective figure, possibly a reflection of the poet himself, who questions their actions and fears the consequences of society's judgment. The poem's brevity and fragmented lines convey a sense of isolation and desperation, as the speaker grapples with their own mortality. Compared to cummings' earlier works, such as \"Buffalo Bill's,\" which celebrate the American spirit, \"Me up at does\" exhibits a darker, more introspective tone, reflecting the disillusionment and skepticism prevalent during the interwar period.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)2GreatThank youLovelyLike (7)Likes:nitr,Caiden jackson,AirMuffin2001,Oragedude,Paul Preston,AAPoet7,myacereporter,MelkaniabhijeeOlder commentsOragedude- bruh i dont get this, rip. wait ayyyy lmao i get it. liton Mar 06 2019 01:59 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserAirMuffin2001- This means that the rat is poisoned by the human and the mouse was looking for food because he wanted to live.on Mar 06 2019 09:35 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserComments from the archiveLadie Lee- Exactly.on Jul 22 2005 04:28 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTouchof1der- It's amazing how profound this man can be in such a small amount of space and using such a minimal amount of words.

I love the first stanza:(will you teach awretch to livestraighter than a needle)This is a thought provoking piece, content- and format-wise.A/E/Son Mar 26 2004 02:59 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192e.e. cummingsFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By e.e. cummings3.3k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bb(33)Ted Hughes(91)Walter de la Mare(192)Dorothy Parker(6)Max Ehrmann(313)Sara Teasdale(433)Paul Laurence Dunbar(308)Christina Georgina Rossetti(120)Jose MartiMore by e.e. cummingsList all \u00bbplato told36why must itself up every of a park26Chansons Innocentes: I1The Eagle18ygUDuh718next to of course god america i824from tulips and chimneys12Seeker Of Truth05i carry your heart with me124509i like my body when it is with your152690may i feel said he124356maggie and milly and molly and may96302l(a...

The speaker personifies silence as \"the blood whose flesh / is singing\" and then \"unsinging,\" suggesting a tension between life and death. The contrast between the vibrant \"april\" and the barren \"autumn\" emphasizes the bleakness of the winter landscape.The speaker's desire for \"terrible anonymity\" and the \"murdering minus of cold\" reflects a longing for escape from the pain of existence. The violent imagery of \"millionary knives of wind\" and \"scatter his nothing\" conveys the destructive force of nature and the vulnerability of the individual.The poem's unusual capitalization and punctuation create a sense of fragmentation and disorientation, reflecting the speaker's state of mind. The final lines offer a glimmer of hope, as \"gently\" and \"absolute peace\" suggest a potential resolution or transcendence. Overall, the poem captures the existential angst and longing for oblivion characteristic of early 20th-century modernism, while employing innovative language and imagery to create a unique and haunting experience.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)0I enjoyedGood shareFantasticLike (1)e.e. cummingsFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By e.e. cummings1.9k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by e.e. cummingsList all \u00bbplato told36why must itself up every of a park26Chansons Innocentes: I1The Eagle18ygUDuh718next to of course god america i824from tulips and chimneys12Seeker Of Truth05i carry your heart with me124509i like my body when it is with your152690may i feel said he124356maggie and milly and molly and may96302l(a...

the arrival of spring and the promise of new life. The speaker addresses various natural elements, such as the earth, elm, wind, and Zeus, invoking their sensual and erotic qualities.The imagery is rich and evocative, drawing on classical mythology and Renaissance art. The language is elevated and formal, with a complex syntax that reflects the poem's intellectual and emotional depth.The poem's structure is carefully crafted, with each section exploring a different aspect of the theme. The first section focuses on the earth's longing for the rain, while the second section celebrates the arrival of spring and the renewal of nature. The third section reflects on the human experience of desire and the relationship between nature and the soul.In comparison to the author's other works, this poem is more traditional in its form and style. However, it still exhibits the author's characteristic use of language and imagery to create a vivid and memorable poetic experience.For the time period, this poem is representative of the modernist movement in poetry, which sought to challenge traditional forms and explore new modes of expression. It also reflects the influence of Symbolism, with its emphasis on the interplay of symbols and the exploration of the subconscious.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)0LovelyAmazingGreatLike (1)e.e. cummingsFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By e.e. cummings2.3k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by e.e. cummingsList all \u00bbplato told36why must itself up every of a park26Chansons Innocentes: I1The Eagle18ygUDuh718next to of course god america i824from tulips and chimneys12Seeker Of Truth05i carry your heart with me124509i like my body when it is with your152690may i feel said he124356maggie and milly and molly and may96302l(a...

Similar to other works by e.e. cummings, it challenges conventional grammar and syntax, creating a fragmented and dreamlike atmosphere.The poem's fragmented structure mimics the speaker's tumultuous emotions, suggesting a longing for connection and intimacy. The repeated use of consonants and vowel sounds creates a sense of rhythm and movement, enhancing the poem's musicality. The poem's brevity and use of lowercase letters give it an intimate and confessional tone.In contrast to cummings's other works, this poem has a more abstract and surreal quality. It lacks the playful and whimsical elements often found in his poetry, instead focusing on the raw and intense emotions of desire. Compared to the time period in which it was written (early 20th century), the poem's experimental and unconventional form reflects the modernist movement's challenge to traditional literary norms.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)2Thank youEnjoyableGreatLike (2)Tip:  One line I stumbled on is _, maybe rephrase to _Learn commentingLikes:Jeremy Ephe,RA KenyonTo reply, click a comment.Older commentsRA Kenyon- I often liken Mr Cummings to Mr Pollock, who likewise dabbles in dribbles with delight.on May 21 2021 03:38 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserJeremy Ephe- it is drawn out......and when I had a bloody cough just the other day the entire family flipped Ed.

And then flattened dreamlessnessesFlattened has many meaning ain this case the definition would be \"informalknock someone down with power and vigor\"Dreamlessness means \"uncountable\".So 'flattened dreamlessnesses'Means the \"all the uncountable people who say the will knock down someone with their power.\"Wait spit...Wait as in like a delay for something.Spit and coughing the correlation is intriguing to me.Cause I'm thinking that coughing and spitting are\u00a0 very close. Except one is more uncontrollable than another.Like people can spit at any time they want.Coughing is involuntary most of the time. Thanks to our Medulla Oblongata.I think the reason why he spells out the word coughing is to get the attention of the reader.Why spell out coughing?\"Foolish shapescoughingwith men more on than in them\"Coughing up false tales.Also not sure it was in his culture but when people would say a curse word they would spit after it. Cause it was bad.So in conclusion.I believe his poem was about don't talk about it be about it.Stop talking about your dreams coughing your life away being sick in the cycle.\"Coughing with men more on than in them\"Maybe he meant be a man.Hope you enjoyed my break down.

The angels, guardians of the child's innocence, watch over her bedside. The mention of \"God's laughing in Heaven\" and the \"Sailing Seven\" symbolize divine protection and happiness. However, the mother expresses a bittersweet note, acknowledging that the child's growth and independence will bring both joy and the inevitable separation from her.Compared to Yeats's other works, this poem is devoid of his typical themes of Irish mythology and Irish nationalism. Instead, it focuses on the universal and timeless experience of a mother's love. It reflects the sentimentality and gentleness found in many lullabies, aligning with the Victorian era's emphasis on domesticity and family values.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (11)6Good postLovelyNicely pennedLike (11)Likes: ,DuskenFae,Morgan Mahira,K.T.

Indeed, in poems from the latter half of his career, Classical mythology appears far more often than Irish. I'm also unsure as to why you think it's a 'mother's love' being expressed here. I'm a father and the sentiments are ones that I often feel.At the time he wrote this poem, Yeats was deeply immersed in the work of William Blake and it's not difficult to see the influence of both Blake's cradle poems from 'Songs of Innocence and Experience'.on Aug 06 2024 02:54 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRead more \u2192Ilia Salari- Lovely poem.on Jan 27 2023 04:09 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserPeyrbupp77899- timeles beautyAmazingon Apr 21 2021 02:36 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- eitul elegaon Sep 13 2019 05:19 AM PSTEditDeleteAlesana The Band- Beautiful.on Feb 22 2014 06:21 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserGpnbuddy- Yeats wrote this for me to give to my grandson.on Apr 11 2011 02:15 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserComments from the archive\u2190 Previous12Next \u2192- ...there is no sadness here at all.

This is a seven star star-cluster in the constellation Taurus.  In Ancient Greece the stars in this star group were named after the seven daughters of Atlas.  The name Pleiades most likely comes from Ancient Greek mariners, because in the Mediterranean, these stars are most visable during the seven sailing months.

I like Yeats' last poems best, the ones he wrote when he was older or just before his death. While his earlier poems are certainly excellent, with a lifetime of experience to draw on, he only managed to become a master of poetry later in life. Poems like this, retrospective and contemplative, serve an important purpose in allowing readers with years less of experience in life to understand how things might change as they grow older.on Mar 24 2004 07:19 AM PSTEditDeleteRead more \u2192Unbridled1- I find this piece to be very interesting and also quite sad.

The use of short, declarative sentences creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The conversational tone draws the reader into the speaker's inner struggle.Compared to Frost's other works, \"A Minor Bird\" is less overtly symbolic and more focused on personal experience.

And I begin to fear they never will. All they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered. Nearer in plight their neighbors are than distance.SMOKE- I am the guardian wraith of starlit smoke that leans out this and that way from their chimney. I will not have their happiness despaired of.MIST- No one - not I would give them up for lost simply because they don't know where they are. \u00a0I am the damper counterpart of smoke that gives off from a garden ground at night. But lifts no higher than a garden grows. I cotton to their landscape. That's who I am. I am no further from their fate than you areSMOKE- They must by now have learned the native tongue. Why don't they ask the red man where they are?MIST - They often do, and none the wiser for it. So do they also ask philosophers who come to look in on them from the pulpit. They will ask anyone there is to ask - In the fond faith accumulated fact - will of itself take fireand light the world up.

But who they are is too much to believe - either for them or the onlooking world.

Mist expresses doubt about the sleepers' awareness of their surroundings and their place in the world. Smoke, on the other hand, insists on their resilience and the potential for enlightenment.The poem reflects Frost's preoccupation with isolation and the search for self-knowledge. Compared to his other works, it shares themes of uncertainty and human limitations. However, it also incorporates a philosophical dimension, exploring the nature of reality and the relationship between inner and outer worlds.The conversation between Mist and Smoke suggests a perpetual cycle of questioning and searching. The sleepers represent the human condition, striving for knowledge and an understanding of their existence. The poem's use of personification and imagery creates a dreamlike atmosphere, blurring the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical.Moreover, the poem comments on the limitations of conventional learning and the pursuit of external validation. Mist and Smoke suggest that true enlightenment comes from within, through introspection and a connection with nature. The ending leaves a sense of mystery and unresolved questions, mirroring the ongoing nature of our own existential journey.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (6)5LovelyWell writtenThank you!Like (6)Translated by Jose Domingo GarciaLikes:Terry Collett, ,Amy Elizabeth Stares,Ken Doll,CBRussell,KindPoetTo reply, click a comment.- kudosNicely done!on Dec 30 2018 10:18 PM PSTEditDeleteAmy Elizabeth Stares- Killed it !on Sep 16 2018 10:04 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Very good workon Apr 20 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poem and themeon Oct 26 2018 12:05 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poemon Aug 02 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Fine poemClever jobon Jul 17 2018 12:25 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poemon Jul 03 2018 12:26 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Classic poemon May 13 2018 12:04 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserNana Penn- Inspired!Simple, yet complex.\u00a0 Love Robert Frosts poetry/Summarize the story:\u00a0 They must by now have learned the native tongue.

You rememberYou said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,The early Mormons made a settlementAnd built a stone baptismal font outdoors-But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountainTo go West to a worse fight with the desert.You said you'd seen the stone baptismal font.Well, take me there.'Someday I will.''Today.''Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?Let's talk about it.''Let's go see the place.''To shut you up I'll tell you what I'll do:I'll find that fountain if it takes all summer,And both of our united strengths, to do it.''You've lost it, then?''Not so but I can find it.No doubt it's grown up some to woods around it.The mountain may have shifted since I saw itIn eighty-five.''As long ago as that?''If I remember rightly, it had sprungA leak and emptied then. And forty yearsCan do a good deal to bad masonry.You won't see any Mormon swimming in it.But you have said it, and we're off to find it.Old as I am, I'm going to let myselfBe dragged by you all over everywhere- ''I thought you were a guide.''I am a guide,And that's why I can't decently refuse you.'We made a day of it out of the world,Ascending to descend to reascend.The old man seriously took his bearings,And spoke his doubts in every open place.We came out on a look-off where we facedA cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,Or stained by vegetation from above,A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.'Well, if I haven't brought you to the fountain,At least I've brought you to the famous Bottle.''I won't accept the substitute. It's empty.''So's everything.''I want my fountain.''I guess you'd find the fountain just as empty.And anyway this tells me where I am.''Hadn't you long suspected where you were?''You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?Look here, you treat your guide with due respectIf you don't want to spend the night outdoors.I vow we must be near the place from whereThe two converging slides, the avalanches,On Marshall, look like donkey's ears.We may as well see that and save the day.''Don't donkey's ears suggest we shake our own?''For God's sake, aren't you fond of viewing nature?You don't like nature. All you like is books.What signify a donkey's cars and bottle,However natural? Give you your books!Well then, right here is where I show you books.Come straight down off this mountain just as fastAs we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.It's hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.'Be ready, I thought, for almost anything.We struck a road I didn't recognize,But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoesIn dust once more. We followed this a mile,Perhaps, to where it ended at a houseI didn't know was there. It was the kindTo bring me to for broad-board paneling.I never saw so good a house deserted.'Excuse me if I ask you in a windowThat happens to be broken, Davis said.'The outside doors as yet have held against us.I want to introduce you to the peopleWho used to live here. They were Robinsons.You must have heard of Clara Robinson,The poetess who wrote the book of versesAnd had it published. It was all aboutThe posies on her inner windowsill,And the birds on her outer windowsill,And how she tended both, or had them tended:She never tended anything herself.She was 'shut in' for life. She lived her wholeLife long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.I'll show You how she had her sills extendedTo entertain the birds and hold the flowers.Our business first's up attic with her books.'We trod uncomfortably on crunching glassThrough a house stripped of everythingExcept, it seemed, the poetess's poems.Books, I should say!- if books are what is needed.A whole edition in a packing caseThat, overflowing like a horn of plenty,Or like the poetess's heart of love,Had spilled them near the window, toward the lightWhere driven rain had wet and swollen them.Enough to stock a village library-Unfortunately all of one kind, though.They bad been brought home from some publisherAnd taken thus into the family.Boys and bad hunters had known what to doWith stone and lead to unprotected glass:Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?By being invisible for what it was,Or else by some remoteness that defied themTo find out what to do to hurt a poem.Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,To send it sailing out the attic windowTill it caught wind and, opening out its covers,Tried to improve on sailing like a tileBy flying like a bird (silent in flight,But all the burden of its body song),Only to tumble like a stricken bird,And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.Books were not thrown irreverently about.They simply lay where someone now and then,Having tried one, had dropped it at his feetAnd left it lying where it fell rejected.Here were all those the poetess's lifeHad been too short to sell or give away.'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.'Why not take two or three?''Take all you want.'Good-looking books like that.' He picked one freshIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.He read in one and I read in another,Both either looking for or finding something.The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.I was soon satisfied for the time being.All the way home I kept rememberingThe small book in my pocket. It was there.The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heavenAt having eased her heart of one more copy-Legitimately. My demand upon her,Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.In time she would be rid of all her books.\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposesShow analysisRead more \u2192Analysis (ai):In \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books,\" Robert Frost weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature. The poem's protagonist embarks on a journey to rediscover a long-lost fountain, but his quest ultimately leads him to a profound encounter with the written word.Like many of Frost's other works, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is characterized by its vivid imagery and deceptively simple language. The poem's opening lines establish a sense of anticipation and wonder as the speaker learns of a mysterious mountain that holds promise of great fortune. However, as the journey progresses, the speaker's hopes are gradually dashed, and he is confronted with the harsh realities of time and change.The poem's central metaphor, the fountain, serves as a powerful symbol of the protagonist's longing for connection and meaning in life. Like the mythical Fountain of Youth, the fountain represents a desire to escape the limitations of time and find renewal. However, just as the protagonist's physical search for the fountain proves futile, so too does his search for spiritual fulfillment in the external world.Ultimately, it is through his encounter with the poetess Clara Robinson's books that the protagonist finds a sense of solace and purpose. The books become a metaphor for the power of literature to transcend the boundaries of time and provide a window into the human experience. Frost's portrayal of the poetess's \"shut in for life\" condition suggests the transformative power of art to liberate the spirit even in the face of physical limitations.In its exploration of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is a characteristically complex and moving poem by Robert Frost. Like many of his other works, it invites multiple readings and challenges the reader to confront the essential questions of life and meaning.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)1Enjoyed itEnjoyed itGreatLike (1)Likes:Terry CollettTerry Collett- Engaging poemon Sep 26 2019 08:23 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRobert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost2.3k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326555-A-Fountain--a-Bottle--a-Donkey-s-Ears--and-Some-Books-by-Robert-Frost"}

It evokes a sense of nostalgia and childhood innocence.Unlike Frost's other works, such as \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" this poem lacks philosophical undertones and instead focuses on a charming and relatable anecdote.The poem paints a vivid picture of a girl's determination and playful nature. It highlights her desire for independence and her willingness to work hard to achieve her goal.The use of colloquial language and humor adds a sense of authenticity and warmth. The girl's antics, such as running away from her \"not-nice load\" of dung, show her youthful exuberance.Overall, \"A Girl's Garden\" stands as a testament to the joys and challenges of childhood and the power of memories to shape our lives.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)0Good workGreatThanksLike (7)Robert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost8.5k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326593-A-Girl-s-Garden-by-Robert-Frost"}

It captures the allure and fleeting beauty of the event, comparing it to a wizard's magic and a witch's spell. The sun's warmth initially rouses the \"silver lizards\" (drops of water) from the snow, but it is the moon's chill that ultimately freezes them in place. The poem's vivid imagery and dynamic language evoke a sense of wonder and awe at the natural world. Compared to Frost's other works, it shares themes of nature, the interplay of light and shadow, and human attempts to control the uncontrollable. It reflects the era's fascination with naturalism and the power of the natural world.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (2)1LovelyGood workWell writtenLike (2)Likes:Skye Darkholme,- very very wordy need to digest slowly to appreciateon Jun 24 2019 04:27 AM PSTEditDeleteRobert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost3.4k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07A Peck of Gold210The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326581-A-Hillside-Thaw-by-Robert-Frost"}

It reflects Robert Frost's signature themes of transience and missed opportunities. Compared to his other works, it is relatively concise and accessible, lacking the complex symbolism and dense language found in poems like \"The Road Not Taken\" and \"Birches.\"Set against the backdrop of the industrial era, the poem captures the tension between progress and a longing for connection with the natural world.

The snow's \"speckled with grime\" surface evokes memories, like the faded headlines of a forgotten newspaper. This suggests a lost past, events and experiences that have faded from memory.Frost's use of \"a blow-away paper\" captures the ephemeral nature of both snow and memory. Just as the wind can scatter newspapers, time can erode our memories, leaving only fragments behind. The poem's brevity and stark imagery create a sense of loss or a longing for what has been forgotten.Compared to Frost's other works, such as \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" this poem lacks the vivid descriptions of nature. Instead, it focuses on the interplay between memory and the physical world, exploring the subtle ways in which past experiences shape our perception of the present.Set in the early 20th century, the poem captures a sense of nostalgia and the changing landscape of time. The newspaper metaphor references a form of communication that is now largely obsolete, further emphasizing the sense of a bygone era.Overall, \"A Patch of Old Snow\" is a minimalist and introspective poem that examines the fragility of memory and the fleeting nature of experience. Its simplicity and understated imagery leave room for contemplation and personal interpretation.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (31)9LovelyInspiringFantasticLike (31)Likes:RobertRichard,I-Like-Rhymes,Terry Collett,DianeAH,Pedro J Garcia,Skye Darkholme,Lady Iridescent,L Spirit, ,Vaishkhushi,RaveEnding,DVAted,William Pencraft,menace to linear time,Spoken Poet, ,Lsenyane,Ashany,David Welch,Matcha2000,Huggleberry Gin,Singh27,alchemy s march, ,r99040721m, ,Messypalette,Ddwil09,Bhaskar Mukharjee,f2399,Stephen76,Gwen D.,Alena Vyshemirskaia,Ken Doll,Jordan Pallotta-To reply, click a comment.Alena Vyshemirskaia- such a subtle beauty in this poemon Apr 28 2020 11:22 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserQueenOfDarkenDreams.- kudosNicely doneon May 09 2019 10:43 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserI-Like-Rhymes- A poem (and a message) worth remembering.on Jan 26 2019 05:09 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserDianeAH- I have always liked this poem.\u00a0 The same today as it was back then. forgotten news.\u00a0 It doesn't take long for today's to become forgotten yesterdays.on Jan 25 2019 07:57 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Classic poemon Apr 20 2018 08:19 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserTerry Collett- Good poem and themeon Jun 29 2018 11:49 PM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserMenace to linear time- I just love iton Jan 02 2018 03:13 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRobertRichard- incredible!Enjoyed iton Nov 20 2017 05:33 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore User- Poems from a bit of trash.

The narrator's youthful belief that dust carries gold symbolizes the initial optimism of the gold seekers. However, the repetitive line \"I was one of the children told\" underscores the inevitability of disappointment as the dream of wealth fades.The poem captures the ephemeral nature of the Gold Rush. The dust that promised fortune becomes merely a nuisance, highlighting the fragility of human hopes. Unlike Frost's earlier work, which often celebrated rural New England life, \"A Peck of Gold\" reveals a more urban and disillusioned perspective, reflecting the social and economic changes that swept the nation during the late 19th century.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (10)2GreatI enjoyedGood workLike (10)Likes: ,Thor lover 95,Eric Seaburg,Keng,Hanging Petals, ,Ricardo Montolivo,biirdbraiin,Wynnie1,Sam Mushtaq- The necessity of optimism and the corresponding disappointment when it is unrealised.on Oct 21 2024 10:57 PM PSTEditDeleteKenny Wilson- Fineon Nov 04 2022 05:39 AM PSTReport ContentIgnore UserRobert FrostFollowRead more \u2192Browse allFamous poems>By Robert Frost7.5k views+listShare it with your friends:Make comments, explore modern poetry.Join today for free!Or Sign up with FacebookTop poemsList all \u00bbBluebird10574185Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night6782415Introduction to Poetry7852182Sonnet 116: 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds...'280942About Marriage191630Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening5451668Have you read these poets?List all \u00bbMore by Robert FrostList all \u00bbIn A Poem217Quandary23Unharvested0A Girl's Garden07The Master Speed0The Peaceful Shepherd04An Encounter03The Freedom Of The Moon16Lodged04The Door In The Dark04The Onset1A Star In A Stoneboat02Maple12The Last Word of a Blue Bird12Profanity : Our optional filter replaced words with *** on this page \u2022ConfigureHelp / Contact us", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326592-A-Peck-of-Gold-by-Robert-Frost"}

In the juvescence of the year\nCame Christ the tiger\nIn depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,\nTo be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\nAmong whispers; by Mr. Silvero\nWith caressing hands, at Limoges\nWho walked all night in the next room;\nBy Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\nBy Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\nShifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\nWho turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\nWeave the wind. I have no ghosts,\nAn old man in a draughty house\nUnder a windy knob.\nAfter such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\nHistory has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\nAnd issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\nGuides us by vanities. Think now\nShe gives when our attention is distracted\nAnd what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\nThat the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\nWhat's not believed in, or if still believed,\nIn memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\nInto weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with\nTill the refusal propagates a fear. Think\nNeither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\nAre fathered by our heroism. Virtues\nAre forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\nThese tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\nThe tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours.

What will the spider do,\nSuspend its operations, will the weevil\nDelay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled\nBeyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear\nIn fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits\nOf Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,\nWhite feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,\nAnd an old man driven by the Trades\nTo a sleepy corner.\nTenants of the house,\nThoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8453701-Gerontion-by-T-S-Eliot"}

And he will\nBe at peace with himself when he dies\nInnocent with his fellow innocents.\nBut I am not living with my hungry\nAnd persecuted people who are walking\nIn the procession of death toward\nMartyrdom...I am here beyond the\nBroad seas living in the shadow of\nTranquillity, and in the sunshine of\nPeace...I am afar from the pitiful\nArena and the distressed, and cannot\nBe proud of ought, not even of my own\nTears.\nWhat can an exiled son do for his\nStarving people, and of what value\nUnto them is the lamentation of an\nAbsent poet?\nWere I an ear of corn grown in the earth\nof my country, the hungry child would\nPluck me and remove with my kernels\nThe hand of Death form his soul. Were\nI a ripe fruit in the gardens of my\nCountry, the starving women would\nGather me and sustain life. Were I\nA bird flying the sky of my country,\nMy hungry brother would hunt me and\nRemove with the flesh of my body the\nShadow of the grave from his body.\nBut, alas! I am not an ear of corn\nGrown in the plains of Syria, nor a\nRipe fruit in the valleys of Lebanon;\nThis is my disaster, and this is my\nMute calamity which brings humiliation\nBefore my soul and before the phantoms\nOf the night...This is the painful\nTragedy which tightens my tongue and\nPinions my arms and arrests me usurped\nOf power and of will and of action.\nThis is the curse burned upon my\nForehead before God and man.\nAnd oftentimes they say unto me,\n'The disaster of your country is\nBut naught to calamity of the\nWorld, and the tears and blood shed\nBy your people are as nothing to\nThe rivers of blood and tears\nPouring each day and night in the\nValleys and plains of the earth...'\nYes, but the death of my people is\nA silent accusation; it is a crime\nConceived by the heads of the unseen serpents...\nIt is a Sceneless tragedy...And if my\nPeople had attacked the despots\nAnd oppressors and died rebels,\nI would have said, 'Dying for\nFreedom is nobler than living in\nThe shadow of weak submission, for\nHe who embraces death with the sword\nOf Truth in his hand will eternalize\nWith the Eternity of Truth, for Life\nIs weaker than Death and Death is\nWeaker than Truth.\nIf my nation had partaken in the war\nOf all nations and had died in the\nField of battle, I would say that\nThe raging tempest had broken with\nIts might the green branches; and\nStrong death under the canopy of\nThe tempest is nobler than slow\nPerishment in the arms of senility.\nBut there was no rescue from the\nClosing jaws...My people dropped\nAnd wept with the crying angels.\nIf an earthquake had torn my\nCountry asunder and the earth had\nEngulfed my people into its bosom,\nI would have said, 'A great and\nMysterious law has been moved by\nThe will of divine force, and it\nWould be pure madness if we frail\nMortals endeavoured to probe its\nDeep secrets...'\nBut my people did not die as rebels;\nThey were not killed in the field\nOf Battle; nor did the earthquake\nShatter my country and subdue them.\nDeath was their only rescuer, and\nStarvation their only spoils.\nMy people died on the cross....\nThey died while their hands\nstretched toward the East and West,\nWhile the remnants of their eyes\nStared at the blackness of the\nFirmament...They died silently,\nFor humanity had closed its ears\nTo their cry. They died because\nThey did not befriend their enemy.\nThey died because they loved their\nNeighbours. They died because\nThey placed trust in all humanity.\nThey died because they did not\nOppress the oppressors. They died\nBecause they were the crushed\nFlowers, and not the crushing feet.\nThey died because they were peace\nMakers. They perished from hunger\nIn a land rich with milk and honey.\nThey died because monsters of\nHell arose and destroyed all that\nTheir fields grew, and devoured the\nLast provisions in their bins....\nThey died because the vipers and\nSons of vipers spat out poison into\nThe space where the Holy Cedars and\nThe roses and the jasmine breathe\nTheir fragrance.\nMy people and your people, my Syrian\nBrother, are dead....What can be\nDone for those who are dying? Our\nLamentations will not satisfy their\nHunger, and our tears will not quench\nTheir thirst; what can we do to save\nThem between the iron paws of\nHunger? My brother, the kindness\nWhich compels you to give a part of\nYour life to any human who is in the\nShadow of losing his life is the only\nVirtue which makes you worthy of the\nLight of day and the peace of the\nNight....Remember, my brother,\nThat the coin which you drop into\nThe withered hand stretching toward\nYou is the only golden chain that\nBinds your rich heart to the\nLoving heart of God.....\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326976-Dead-Are-My-People-by-Khalil-Gibran"}

I dare not unveil\nThe shadows that float o'er Eternity's vale;\nNought waits for the good but a spirit of Love,\nThat will hail their blest advent to regions above.\nFor Love, Mortal, gleams through the gloom of my sway,\nAnd the shades which surround me fly fast at its ray.\nHast thou loved?--Then depart from these regions of hate,\nAnd in slumber with me blunt the arrows of fate.\nI offer a calm habitation to thee.--\nSay, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?\nMORTAL:\nOh! sweet is thy slumber! oh! sweet is the ray\nWhich after thy night introduces the day;\nHow concealed, how persuasive, self-interest\u2019s breath,\nThough it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death!\nI hoped that I quite was forgotten by all,\nYet a lingering friend might be grieved at my fall,\nAnd duty forbids, though I languish to die,\nWhen departure might heave Virtue\u2019s breast with a sigh.\nO Death!

{"title": "A Man", "author": "Charles Bukowski", "text": "George was lying in his trailer, flat on his back, watching a small portable T.V. His\ndinner dishes were undone, his breakfast dishes were undone, he needed a shave, and ash\nfrom his rolled cigarettes dropped onto his undershirt. Some of the ash was still burning.\nSometimes the burning ash missed the undershirt and hit his skin, then he cursed, brushing\nit away. There was a knock on the trailer door. He got slowly to his feet and answered the\ndoor. It was Constance. She had a fifth of unopened whiskey in a bag.\n\"George, I left that son of a bitch, I couldn't stand that son of a bitch\nanymore.\"\n\"Sit down.\"\nGeorge opened the fifth, got two glasses, filled each a third with whiskey, two thirds\nwith water. He sat down on the bed with Constance. She took a cigarette out of her purse\nand lit it. She was drunk and her hands trembled.\n\"I took his damn money too. I took his damn money and split while he was at work.\nYou don't know how I've suffered with that son of a bitch.\" \"\nLemme have a smoke,\" said George. She handed it to him and as she leaned near,\nGeorge put his arm around her, pulled her over and kissed her.\n\"You son of a bitch,\" she said, \"I missed you.\"\n\"I miss those good legs of yours , Connie. I've really missed those good\nlegs.\"\n\"You still like 'em?\"\n\"I get hot just looking.\"\n\"I could never make it with a college guy,\" said Connie. \"They're too\nsoft, they're milk toast. And he kept his house clean. George , it was like having a maid.\nHe did it all. The place was spotless. You could eat beef stew right off the crapper. He\nwas antiseptic, that's what he was.\"\n\"Drink up, you'll feel better.\"\n\"And he couldn't make love.\"\n\"You mean he couldn't get it up?\"\n\"Oh he got it up, he got it up all the time. But he didn't know how to make a\nwoman happy, you know. He didn't know what to do. All that money, all that education, he\nwas useless.\"\n\"I wish I had a college education.\"\n\"You don't need one. You have everything you need, George.\"\n\"I'm just a flunky. All the shit jobs.\"\n\"I said you have everything you need, George. You know how to make a woman\nhappy.\"\n\"Yeh?\"\n\"Yes. And you know what else? His mother came around! His mother! Two or three\ntimes a week. And she'd sit there looking at me, pretending to like me but all the time\nshe was treating me like I was a whore. Like I was a big bad whore stealing her son away\nfrom her! Her precious Wallace! Christ! What a mess!\" \"He claimed he loved me.\nAnd I'd say, 'Look at my pussy, Walter!' And he wouldn't look at my pussy. He said, 'I\ndon't want to look at that thing.' That thing! That's what he called it! You're not afraid\nof my pussy, are you, George?\"\n\"It's never bit me yet.\" \"But you've bit it, you've nibbled it, haven't\nyou George?\"\n\"I suppose I have.\"\n\"And you've licked it , sucked it?\"\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\"You know damn well, George, what you've done.\"\n\"How much money did you get?\"\n\"Six hundred dollars.\"\n\"I don't like people who rob other people, Connie.\"\n\"That's why you're a fucking dishwasher. You're honest. But he's such an ass,\nGeorge. And he can afford the money, and I've earned it\u2026 him and his mother and his\nlove, his mother-love, his clean l;little wash bowls and toilets and disposal bags and\nbreath chasers and after shave lotions and his little hard-ons and his precious\nlovemaking. All for himself, you understand, all for himself! You know what a woman\nwants, George.\"\n\"Thanks for the whiskey, Connie. Lemme have another cigarette.\"\nGeorge filled them up again. \"I missed your legs, Connie. I've really missed those\nlegs. I like the way you wear those high heels. They drive me crazy. These modern women\ndon't know what they're missing. The high heel shapes the calf, the thigh, the ass; it\nputs rhythm into the walk. It really turns me on!\"\n\"You talk like a poet, George. Sometimes you talk like that. You are one hell of a\ndishwasher.\"\n\"You know what I'd really like to do?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I'd like to whip you with my belt on the legs, the ass, the thighs. I'd like to\nmake you quiver and cry and then when you're quivering and crying I'd slam it into you\npure love.\"\n\"I don't want that, George. You've never talked like that to me before. You've\nalways done right with me.\"\n\"Pull your dress up higher.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Pull your dress up higher, I want to see more of your legs.\"\n\"You like my legs, don't you, George?\"\n\"Let the light shine on them!\"\nConstance hiked her dress.\n\"God Christ shit,\" said George.\n\"You like my legs?\"\n\"I love your legs!\" Then George reached across the bed and slapped Constance\nhard across the face. Her cigarette flipped out of her mouth.\n\"what'd you do that for?\"\n\"You fucked Walter! You fucked Walter!\"\n\"So what the hell?\"\n\"So pull your dress up higher!\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Do what I say!\" George slapped again, harder. Constance hiked her skirt.\n\"Just up to the panties!\" shouted George. \"I don't quite want to see the\npanties!\"\n\"Christ, George, what's gone wrong with you?\"\n\"You fucked Walter!\"\n\"George, I swear, you've gone crazy. I want to leave. Let me out of here,\nGeorge!\"\n\"Don't move or I'll kill you!\"\n\"You'd kill me?\"\n\"I swear it!\" George got up and poured himself a shot of straight whiskey,\ndrank it, and sat down next to Constance. He took the cigarette and held it against her\nwrist. She screamed. HE held it there, firmly, then pulled it away.\n\"I'm a man , baby, understand that?\"\n\"I know you're a man , George.\"\n\"Here, look at my muscles!\" George sat up and flexed both of his arms.\n\"Beautiful, eh ,baby? Look at that muscle! Feel it! Feel it!\"\nConstance felt one of the arms, then the other.\n\"Yes, you have a beautiful body, George.\"\n\"I'm a man. I'm a dishwasher but I'm a man, a real man.\"\n\"I know it, George.\" \"I'm not the milk shit you left.\"\n\"I know it.\"\n\"And I can sing, too. You ought to hear my voice.\"\nConstance sat there. George began to sing. He sang \"Old man River.\" Then he\nsang \"Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.\" He sang \"The St. Louis\nBlues.\" He Sang \"God Bless America,\" stopping several times and laughing.\nThen he sat down next to Constance. He said, \"Connie, you have beautiful legs.\"\nHe asked for another cigarette. He smoked it, drank two more drinks, then put his head\ndown on Connie's legs, against the stockings, in her lap, and he said, \"Connie, I\nguess I'm no good, I guess I'm crazy, I'm sorry I hit you, I'm sorry I burned you with\nthat cigarette.\"\nConstance sat there. She ran her fingers through George's hair, stroking him, soothing\nhim. Soon he was asleep. She waited a while longer. Then she lifted his head and placed it\non the pillow, lifted his legs and straightened them out on the bed. She stood up, walked\nto the fifth, poured a jolt of good whiskey in to her glass, added a touch of water and\ndrank it sown. She walked to the trailer door, pulled it open, stepped out, closed it. She\nwalked through the backyard, opened the fence gate, walked up the alley under the one\no'clock moon. The sky was clear of clouds. The same sky full of clouds was up there. She got\nout on the boulevard and walked east and reached the entrance of The Blue Mirror. She\nwalked in, and there was Walter sitting alone and drunk at the end of the bar. She walked\nup and sat down next to him. \"Missed me, baby?\" she asked. Walter looked up. He\nrecognized her. He didn't answer. He looked at the bartender and the bartender walked\ntoward them They all knew each other.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509497-A-Man-by-Charles-Bukowski"}

What riches can you find in this waste sea\nWhere no ship sails, where nothing that's alive\nHas ever come but those man-headed birds,\nKnowing it for the world's end?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Where the world ends\nThe mind is made unchanging, for it finds\nMiracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope,\nThe flagstone under all, the fire of fires,\nThe roots of the world.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shadows before now\nHave driven travellers mad for their own sport.\nForgael\n. Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their\nplot?\nAibric\n. No, no, do not say that.\u00a0 You know right well\nThat I will never lift a hand against you.\nForgael\n. Why should you be more faithful than the rest,\nBeing as doubtful?\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I have called you master\nToo many years to lift a hand against you.\nForgael\n. Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.\nYou've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,\nA melancholy that a cup of wine,\nA lucky battle, or a woman's kiss\nCould not amend.\nAibric.\nI have good spirits enough.\nForgael.\nIf you will give me all your mind awhile -\nAll, all, the very bottom of the bowl -\nI'll show you that I am made differently,\nThat nothing can amend it but these waters,\nWhere I am rid of life - the events of the world -\nWhat do you call it? - that old promise-breaker,\nThe cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,\n\"You will have all you have wished for when you have\nearned\nLand for your children or money in a pot.-\nAnd when we have it we are no happier,\nBecause of that old draught under the door,\nOr creaky shoes.\u00a0 And at the end of all\nHow are we better off than Seaghan the fool,\nThat never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!\nWe have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living\nBreathe on the burnished mirror of the world\nAnd then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,\nAnd find their laughter sweeter to the taste\nFor that brief sighing.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you had loved some woman -\nForgael\n. You say that also? You have heard the voices,\nFor that is what they say - all, all the shadows -\nAengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,\nAnd all the others; but it must be love\nAs they have known it.\u00a0 Now the secret's out;\nFor it is love that I am seeking for,\nBut of a beautiful, unheard-of kind\nThat is not in the world.\nAibric.\nAnd yet the world\nHas beautiful women to please every man.\nForgael\n. But he that gets their love after the fashion\n\"Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope\nAnd bodily tenderness, and finds that even\nThe bed of love, that in the imagination\nHad seemed to be the giver of all peace,\nIs no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,\nAnd as soon finished.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  All that ever loved\nHave loved that way - there is no other way.\nForgael\n. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they\nbelieved there was some other near at hand,\nAnd almost wept because they could not find it.\nAibric\n. When they have twenty years; in middle life\nThey take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,\nAnd let the dream go by.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's not a dream,\nBut the reality that makes our passion\nAs a lamp shadow - no - no lamp, the sun.\nWhat the world's million lips are thirsting for\nMust be substantial somewhere.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I have heard the Druids\nMutter such things as they awake from trance.\nIt may be that the Ever-living know it -\nNo mortal can.\nForgael\nAibric\n. They are besotting you as they besot\nThe crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows\nThat he has been all night upon the hills,\nRiding to hurley, or in the battle-host\nWith the Ever-living.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What if he speak the truth,\nAnd for a dozen hours have been a part\nOf that more powerful life?\nAibric\n,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  His wife knows better.\nHas she not seen him lying like a log,\nOr fumbling in a dream about the house?\nAnd if she hear him mutter of wild riders,\nShe knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing\nThat set him to the fancy.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  All would be well\nCould we but give us wholly to the dreams,\nAnd get into their world that to the sense\nIs shadow, and not linger wretchedly\nAmong substantial things; for it is dreams\nThat lift us to the flowing, changing world\nThat the heart longs for.\u00a0 What is love itself,\nEven though it be the lightest of light love,\nBut dreams that hurry from beyond the world\nTo make low laughter more than meat and drink,\nThough it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,\nCould we but mix ourselves into a dream,\nNot in its image on the mirror!\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While\nWe're in the body that's impossible.\nForgael\n. And yet I cannot think they're leading me\nTo death; for they that promised to me love\nAs those that can outlive the moon have known it, '\nHad the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,\nInto their shining limbs - I've had great teachers.\nAengus and Edain ran up out of the wave -\nYou'd never doubt that it was life they promised\nHad you looked on them face to face as I did,\nWith so red lips, and running on such feet,\nAnd having such wide-open, shining eyes.\nAibric\n. It's certain they are leading you to death.\nNone but the dead, or those that never lived,\nCan know that ecstasy.\u00a0 Forgael! Forgael!\nAnd you have told me that their journey lies\nTowards the country of the dead.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  What matter\nIf I am going to my death? - for there,\nOr somewhere, I shall find the love they have\npromised.\nThat much is certain.\u00a0 I shall find a woman.\nOne of the Ever-living, as I think -\nOne of the Laughing People - and she and I\nShall light upon a place in the world's core,\nWhere passion grows to be a changeless thing,\nLike charmed apples made of chrysoprase,\nOr chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysclite;\nAnd there, in juggleries of sight and sense,\nBecome one movement, energy, delight,\nUntil the overburthened moon is dead.\n[A number of Sailors enter hurriedly.]\nFirst Sailor\n. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice!\nAnd we are almost on her!\nSecond Sailor.\nWe had not known\nBut for the ambergris and sandalwood.\nFirst Sailor\n. NO; but opoponax and cinnamon.\nForgael\n[taking the tiller from Aibric]. The Ever-living have\nkept my bargain for me,\nAnd paid you on the nail.\nAibric\nTake up that rope\nTo make her fast while we are plundering her.\nFirst Sailor\n. There is a king and queen upon her deck,\nAnd where there is one woman there'll be others.\nAibric\n. Speak lower, or they'll hear.\nFirst Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  They cannot hear;\nThey are too busy with each other.\u00a0 Look!\nHe has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.\nSecond Sailor\n. When she finds out we have better men\naboard\nShe may not be too sorry in the end.\nFirst Sailor\n. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens\nCare more about the kegs of silver and gold\nAnd the high fame that come to them in marriage,\nThan a strong body and a ready hand.\nSecond Sailor.\nThere's nobody is natural but a robber,\nAnd that is why the world totters about\nUpon its bandy legs.\nAibric.\nRun at them now,\nAnd overpower the crew while yet asleep!\n[The Sailors go out.]\n[Voices and the clashing of swords are heard from the\nother ship, which cannot be seen because of the sail.]\nA Voice\n. Armed men have come upon us! O I am slain!\nAnother Voice.\nWake all below!\nAnother Voice\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 Why have you broken our sleep?\nFirst Voice\n. Armed men have come upon us! O I am\nslain!\nForgael\n[who has remained at the tiller]. There! there they\ncome! Gull, gannet, or diver,\nBut with a man's head, or a fair woman's,\nThey hover over the masthead awhile\nTo wait their Fiends; but when their friends have\ncome\nThey'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.\nOne - and one - a couple - five together;\nAnd I will hear them talking in a minute.\nYes, voices! but I do not catch the words.\nNow I can hear.\u00a0 There's one of them that says,\n\"How light we are, now we are changed to birds!'\nAnother answers, \"Maybe we shall find\nOur heart's desire now that we are so light.'\nAnd then one asks another how he died,\nAnd says, \"A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.-\nAnd now they all wheel suddenly and fly\nTo the other side, and higher in the air.\nAnd now a laggard with a woman's head\nComes crying, \"I have run upon the sword.\nI have fled to my beloved in the air,\nIn the waste of the high air, that we may wander\nAmong the windy meadows of the dawn.'\nBut why are they still waiting? why are they\nCircling and circling over the masthead?\nWhat power that is more mighty than desire\nTo hurry to their hidden happiness\nWithholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones\nA meaning in that circling overhead?\nBut what's the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you\nlinger there?\nWhy linger? Run to your desire,\nAre you not happy winged bodies now?\n[His voice sinks again.]\nBeing too busy in the air and the high air,\nThey cannot hear my voice; but what's the meaning?\n[The Sailors have returned.\u00a0 Dectora is with them.]\nForgael\n[turning and seeing her]. Why are you standing\nwith your eyes upon me?\nYou are not the world's core.\u00a0 O no, no, no!\nThat cannot be the meaning of the birds.\nYou are not its core.\u00a0 My teeth are in the world,\nBut have not bitten yet.\nDectora.\nI am a queen,\nAnd ask for satisfaction upon these\nWho have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.\n[Breaking loose from the Sailors who are holding her.]\nLet go my hands!\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why do you cast a shadow?\nWhere do you come from? Who brought you to this\nplace?\nThey would not send me one that casts a shadow.\nDectora\n. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,\nAnd drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,\nAnd blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,\nHad drowned me also.\u00a0 But, being yet alive,\nI ask a fitting punishment for all\nThat raised their hands against him.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are some\nThat weigh and measure all in these waste seas -\nThey that have all the wisdom that's in life,\nAnd all that prophesying images\nMade of dim gold rave out in secret tombs;\nThey have it that the plans of kings and queens\nBut laughter and tears - laughter, laughter, and tears;\nThat every man should carry his own soul\nUpon his shoulders.\nDectora.\nYou've nothing but wild words,\nAnd I would know if you will give me vengeance.\nForgael\n. When she finds out I will not let her go -\nWhen she knows that.\nDectora\n. What is it that you are muttering -\nThat you'll not let me go? I am a queen.\nForgael.\nAlthough you are more beautiful than any,\nI almost long that it were possible;\nBut if I were to put you on that ship,\nWith sailors that were sworn to do your will,\nAnd you had spread a sail for home, a wind\nWould rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge\nIt had washed among the stars and put them out,\nAnd beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,\nUntil you stood before me on the deck -\nAs now.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  Does wandering in these desolate seas\nAnd listening to the cry of wind and wave\nBring madness?\nForgael.\nQueen, I am not mad.\nDectora.\nYet say\nThat unimaginable storms of wind and wave\nWould rise against me.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No, I am not mad -\nIf it be not that hearing messages\nFrom lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,\nAt the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.\nDectora\n. And did those watchers bid you take me\ncaptive?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  Both you and I are taken in the net.\nIt was their hands that plucked the winds awake\nAnd blew you hither; and their mouths have\npromised\nI shall have love in their immortal fashion;\nAnd for this end they gave me my old harp\nThat is more mighty than the sun and moon,\nOr than the shivering casting-net of the stars,\nThat none might take you from me.\nDectora\n[first trembling back from the mast where the harp is,\nand then laughing]. For a moment\nYour raving of a message and a harp\nMore mighty than the stars half troubled me,\nBut all that's raving.\u00a0 Who is there can compel\nThe daughter and the granddaughter of kings\nTo be his bedfellow?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Until your lips\nHave called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.\nDectora\n. My husband and my king died at my feet,\nAnd yet you talk of love.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The movement of time\nIs shaken in these seas, and what one does\nOne moment has no might upon the moment\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I understand you now.\nYou have a Druid craft of wicked sound\nWrung from the cold women of the sea -\nA magic that can call a demon up,\nUntil my body give you kiss for kiss.\nForgael\n. Your soul shall give the kiss.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I am not afraid,\nWhile there's a rope to run into a noose\nOr wave to drown.\u00a0 But I have done with words,\nAnd I would have you look into my face\nAnd know that it is fearless.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Do what you will,\nFor neither I nor you can break a mesh\nOf the great golden net that is about us.\nDectora.\nThere's nothing in the world that's worth a\nfear.\n[She passes Forgael and stands for a moment looking into\nhis face.]\nI have good reason for that thought.\n[She runs suddenly on to the raised part of the poop.]\nAnd now\nI can put fear away as a queen should.\n[She mounts on to the hulwark and turns towards\nForgael.]\nFool, fool! Although you have looked into my face\nYou do not see my purpose.\u00a0 I shall have gone\nBefore a hand can touch me.\nForgael\n[folding his arms].\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My hands are still;\nThe Ever-living hold us.\u00a0 Do what you will,\nYou cannot leap out of the golden net.\nFirst Sailor\n. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon\nAnd measure out a course and bring us home,\nWe'll put this man to death.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I promise it.\nFirst Sailor\n. There is none to take his side.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I am on his side,\nI'll strike a blow for him to give him time\nTo cast his dreams away.\n[Aibric goes in front of Forgael with drawn sword.\u00a0 For-\ngael takes the harp.]\nFirst Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No other'll do it.\n[The Sailors throw Aibric on one side.\u00a0 He falls and lies\nupon the deck.\u00a0 They lift their swords to strike Forgael,\nwho is about to play the harp.\u00a0 The stage begins to\ndarken.\u00a0 The Sailors hesitate in fear.]\nSecond Sailor\n. He has put a sudden darkness over the\nmoon.\nDectora\n.

And I! And I!\n[Forgael plays the harp.]\nFirst Sailor\n[falling into a dream suddenly. But you were\nsaying there is somebody\nUpon that other ship we are to wake.\nYou did not know what brought him to his end,\nBut it was sudden.\nSecond Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 You are in the right;\nI had forgotten that we must go wake him.\nDectora\n. He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,\nAnd set you dreaming.\nSecond Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  How can we have a wake\nWhen we have neither brown nor yellow ale?\nFirst Sailor\n. I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.\nThird Sailor\n. How can we raise the keen that do not\nknow\nWhat name to call him by?\nFirst Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Come to his ship.\nHis name will come into our thoughts in a minute.\nI know that he died a thousand years ago,\nAnd has not yet been waked.\nSecond Sailor\n[beginning to keen]. Ohone! O! O! O!\nThe yew-bough has been broken into two,\nAnd all the birds are scattered.\nAll the Sailors.\nO! O! O! O!\n[They go out keening.]\nDectora\n. Protect me now, gods that my people swear by.\n[Aibric has risen from the deck where he had fallen.\u00a0 He\nhas begun looking for his sword as if in a dream.]\nAibric\n. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand\nWhen I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!\n[He goes dreamily towards the sword, but Dectora runs at\nit and takes it up before he can reach it.]\nAibric\n[sleepily]. Queen, give it me.\nDectora.\nNo, I have need of it.\nAibric\n. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it.\nNow that he's dead I have no need of it,\nFor everything is gone.\nA Sailor\n[calling from the other ship]. Come hither, Aibric,\nAnd tell me who it is that we are waking.\nAibric\n[half to Dectora, half to himself]. What name had\nthat dead king? Arthur of Britain?\nNo, no - not Arthur.\u00a0 I remember now.\nIt was golden-armed Iollan, and he died\nBroken-hearted, having lost his queen\nThrough wicked spells.\u00a0 That is not all the tale,\nFor he was killed.\u00a0 O! O! O! O! O! O!\nFor golden-armed Iollan has been killed.\n[He goes out.]\n[While he has been speaking, and through part of what\nother ship.\u00a0 Dectora stands with the sword lifted in\nfront of Forgael.]\nDectora\n. I will end all your magic on the instant.\n[Her voice becomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword\nslowly, and finally lets it fall.\u00a0 She spreads out her hair.\nShe takes off her crown and lays it upon the deck.]\nThis sword is to lie beside him in the grave.\nIt was in all his battles.\u00a0 I will spread my hair,\nAnd wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,\nFor I have heard that he was proud and laughing,\nBlue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,\nAnd that he died a thousand years ago.\nO; O! O! O!\n[Forgael changes the tune.]\nBut no, that is not it.\nThey killed him at my feet.\u00a0 O! O! O! O!\nFor golden-armed Iollan that I loved-\nBut what is it that made me say I loved him?\nIt was that harper put it in my thoughts,\nBut it is true.\u00a0 Why did they run upon him,\nAnd beat the golden helmet with their swords?\nForgael\n. Do you not know me, lady? I am he\nThat you are weeping for.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No, for he is dead.\nO! O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.\nForgael\n. It was so given out, but I will prove\nThat the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy\nHave buried nothing but my golden arms.\nListen to that low-laughing string of the moon\nAnd you will recollect my face and voice,\nFor you have listened to me playing it\nThese thousand years.\n[He starts up, listening to the birds.\u00a0 The harp slips from\nhis hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks\nbehind him.]\nWhat are the birds at there?\nWhy are they all a-flutter of a sudden?\nWhat are you calling out above the mast?\nIf railing and reproach and mockery\nBecause I have awakened her to love\nBy magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:\nBeing driven on by voices and by dreams\nThat were clear messages from the Ever-living,\nI have done right.\u00a0 What could I but obey?\nAnd yet you make a clamour of reproach.\nDectora\n[laughing]. Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning\nThat I should keen him from the full of the moon\nTo the horn, and he be hale and hearty.\nForgael\n. How have I wronged her now that she is merry?\nBut no, no, no! your cry is not against me.\nYou know the counsels of the Ever-living,\nAnd all that tossing of your wings is joy,\nAnd all that murmuring's but a marriage-song;\nBut if it be reproach, I answer this:\nThere is not one among you that made love\nby any other means.\u00a0 You call it passion,\nConsideration, generosity;\nBut it was all deceit, and flattery\nTo win a woman in her own despite,\nFor love is war, and there is hatred in it;\nAnd if you say that she came willingly -\nDectora\n.

It's empty.'\n'So's everything.'\n'I want my fountain.'\n'I guess you'd find the fountain just as empty.\nAnd anyway this tells me where I am.'\n'Hadn't you long suspected where you were?'\n'You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?\nLook here, you treat your guide with due respect\nIf you don't want to spend the night outdoors.\nI vow we must be near the place from where\nThe two converging slides, the avalanches,\nOn Marshall, look like donkey's ears.\nWe may as well see that and save the day.'\n'Don't donkey's ears suggest we shake our own?'\n'For God's sake, aren't you fond of viewing nature?\nYou don't like nature.

She lived her whole\nLife long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.\nI'll show You how she had her sills extended\nTo entertain the birds and hold the flowers.\nOur business first's up attic with her books.'\nWe trod uncomfortably on crunching glass\nThrough a house stripped of everything\nBooks, I should say!- if books are what is needed.\nA whole edition in a packing case\nThat, overflowing like a horn of plenty,\nOr like the poetess's heart of love,\nHad spilled them near the window, toward the light\nWhere driven rain had wet and swollen them.\nEnough to stock a village library-\nUnfortunately all of one kind, though.\nAnd taken thus into the family.\nBoys and bad hunters had known what to do\nWith stone and lead to unprotected glass:\nShatter it inward on the unswept floors.\nHow had the tender verse escaped their outrage?\nBy being invisible for what it was,\nOr else by some remoteness that defied them\nTo find out what to do to hurt a poem.\nYet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,\nTo send it sailing out the attic window\nTill it caught wind and, opening out its covers,\nTried to improve on sailing like a tile\nBy flying like a bird (silent in flight,\nBut all the burden of its body song),\nOnly to tumble like a stricken bird,\nAnd lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.\nBooks were not thrown irreverently about.\nThey simply lay where someone now and then,\nHaving tried one, had dropped it at his feet\nAnd left it lying where it fell rejected.\nHere were all those the poetess's life\nHad been too short to sell or give away.\n'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.\n'Why not take two or three?'\n'Take all you want.'\nGood-looking books like that.' He picked one fresh\nIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,\nAnd stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.\nHe read in one and I read in another,\nBoth either looking for or finding something.\nThe attic wasps went missing by like bullets.\nI was soon satisfied for the time being.\nAll the way home I kept remembering\nThe small book in my pocket. It was there.\nThe poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven\nAt having eased her heart of one more copy-\nLegitimately. My demand upon her,\nThough slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.\nIn time she would be rid of all her books.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326555-A-Fountain--a-Bottle--a-Donkey-s-Ears--and-Some-Books-by-Robert-Frost"}

Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.\nYou've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,\nA melancholy that a cup of wine,\nA lucky battle, or a woman's kiss\nCould not amend.\nAibric.\nI have good spirits enough.\nForgael.\nIf you will give me all your mind awhile -\nAll, all, the very bottom of the bowl -\nI'll show you that I am made differently,\nThat nothing can amend it but these waters,\nWhere I am rid of life - the events of the world -\nWhat do you call it? - that old promise-breaker,\nThe cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,\n\"You will have all you have wished for when you have\nearned\nLand for your children or money in a pot.-\nAnd when we have it we are no happier,\nBecause of that old draught under the door,\nOr creaky shoes.\u00a0 And at the end of all\nHow are we better off than Seaghan the fool,\nThat never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!\nWe have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living\nBreathe on the burnished mirror of the world\nAnd then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,\nAnd find their laughter sweeter to the taste\nFor that brief sighing.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you had loved some woman -\nForgael\n. You say that also? You have heard the voices,\nFor that is what they say - all, all the shadows -\nAengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,\nAnd all the others; but it must be love\nAs they have known it.\u00a0 Now the secret's out;\nFor it is love that I am seeking for,\nBut of a beautiful, unheard-of kind\nThat is not in the world.\nAibric.\nAnd yet the world\nHas beautiful women to please every man.\nForgael\n. But he that gets their love after the fashion\n\"Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope\nAnd bodily tenderness, and finds that even\nThe bed of love, that in the imagination\nHad seemed to be the giver of all peace,\nIs no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,\nAnd as soon finished.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  All that ever loved\nHave loved that way - there is no other way.\nForgael\n. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they\nbelieved there was some other near at hand,\nAnd almost wept because they could not find it.\nAibric\n. When they have twenty years; in middle life\nThey take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,\nAnd let the dream go by.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's not a dream,\nBut the reality that makes our passion\nAs a lamp shadow - no - no lamp, the sun.\nWhat the world's million lips are thirsting for\nMust be substantial somewhere.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I have heard the Druids\nMutter such things as they awake from trance.\nIt may be that the Ever-living know it -\nNo mortal can.\nForgael\nAibric\n. They are besotting you as they besot\nThe crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows\nThat he has been all night upon the hills,\nRiding to hurley, or in the battle-host\nWith the Ever-living.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What if he speak the truth,\nAnd for a dozen hours have been a part\nOf that more powerful life?\nAibric\n,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  His wife knows better.\nHas she not seen him lying like a log,\nOr fumbling in a dream about the house?\nAnd if she hear him mutter of wild riders,\nShe knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing\nThat set him to the fancy.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  All would be well\nCould we but give us wholly to the dreams,\nAnd get into their world that to the sense\nIs shadow, and not linger wretchedly\nAmong substantial things; for it is dreams\nThat lift us to the flowing, changing world\nThat the heart longs for.\u00a0 What is love itself,\nEven though it be the lightest of light love,\nBut dreams that hurry from beyond the world\nTo make low laughter more than meat and drink,\nThough it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,\nCould we but mix ourselves into a dream,\nNot in its image on the mirror!\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While\nWe're in the body that's impossible.\nForgael\n. And yet I cannot think they're leading me\nTo death; for they that promised to me love\nAs those that can outlive the moon have known it, '\nHad the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,\nInto their shining limbs - I've had great teachers.\nAengus and Edain ran up out of the wave -\nYou'd never doubt that it was life they promised\nHad you looked on them face to face as I did,\nWith so red lips, and running on such feet,\nAnd having such wide-open, shining eyes.\nAibric\n. It's certain they are leading you to death.\nNone but the dead, or those that never lived,\nCan know that ecstasy.\u00a0 Forgael! Forgael!\nAnd you have told me that their journey lies\nTowards the country of the dead.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  What matter\nIf I am going to my death? - for there,\nOr somewhere, I shall find the love they have\npromised.\nThat much is certain.\u00a0 I shall find a woman.\nOne of the Ever-living, as I think -\nOne of the Laughing People - and she and I\nShall light upon a place in the world's core,\nWhere passion grows to be a changeless thing,\nLike charmed apples made of chrysoprase,\nOr chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysclite;\nAnd there, in juggleries of sight and sense,\nBecome one movement, energy, delight,\nUntil the overburthened moon is dead.\n[A number of Sailors enter hurriedly.]\nFirst Sailor\n. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice!\nAnd we are almost on her!\nSecond Sailor.\nWe had not known\nBut for the ambergris and sandalwood.\nFirst Sailor\n. NO; but opoponax and cinnamon.\nForgael\n[taking the tiller from Aibric]. The Ever-living have\nkept my bargain for me,\nAnd paid you on the nail.\nAibric\nTake up that rope\nTo make her fast while we are plundering her.\nFirst Sailor\n. There is a king and queen upon her deck,\nAnd where there is one woman there'll be others.\nAibric\n. Speak lower, or they'll hear.\nFirst Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  They cannot hear;\nThey are too busy with each other.\u00a0 Look!\nHe has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.\nSecond Sailor\n. When she finds out we have better men\naboard\nShe may not be too sorry in the end.\nFirst Sailor\n. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens\nCare more about the kegs of silver and gold\nAnd the high fame that come to them in marriage,\nThan a strong body and a ready hand.\nSecond Sailor.\nThere's nobody is natural but a robber,\nAnd that is why the world totters about\nUpon its bandy legs.\nAibric.\nRun at them now,\nAnd overpower the crew while yet asleep!\n[The Sailors go out.]\n[Voices and the clashing of swords are heard from the\nother ship, which cannot be seen because of the sail.]\nA Voice\n. Armed men have come upon us! O I am slain!\nAnother Voice.\nWake all below!\nAnother Voice\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 Why have you broken our sleep?\nFirst Voice\n. Armed men have come upon us! O I am\nslain!\nForgael\n[who has remained at the tiller]. There! there they\ncome! Gull, gannet, or diver,\nBut with a man's head, or a fair woman's,\nThey hover over the masthead awhile\nTo wait their Fiends; but when their friends have\ncome\nThey'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.\nOne - and one - a couple - five together;\nAnd I will hear them talking in a minute.\nYes, voices! but I do not catch the words.\nNow I can hear.\u00a0 There's one of them that says,\n\"How light we are, now we are changed to birds!'\nAnother answers, \"Maybe we shall find\nOur heart's desire now that we are so light.'\nAnd then one asks another how he died,\nAnd says, \"A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.-\nAnd now they all wheel suddenly and fly\nTo the other side, and higher in the air.\nAnd now a laggard with a woman's head\nComes crying, \"I have run upon the sword.\nI have fled to my beloved in the air,\nIn the waste of the high air, that we may wander\nAmong the windy meadows of the dawn.'\nBut why are they still waiting? why are they\nCircling and circling over the masthead?\nWhat power that is more mighty than desire\nTo hurry to their hidden happiness\nWithholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones\nA meaning in that circling overhead?\nBut what's the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you\nlinger there?\nWhy linger? Run to your desire,\nAre you not happy winged bodies now?\n[His voice sinks again.]\nBeing too busy in the air and the high air,\nThey cannot hear my voice; but what's the meaning?\n[The Sailors have returned.\u00a0 Dectora is with them.]\nForgael\n[turning and seeing her]. Why are you standing\nwith your eyes upon me?\nYou are not the world's core.\u00a0 O no, no, no!\nThat cannot be the meaning of the birds.\nYou are not its core.\u00a0 My teeth are in the world,\nBut have not bitten yet.\nDectora.\nI am a queen,\nAnd ask for satisfaction upon these\nWho have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.\n[Breaking loose from the Sailors who are holding her.]\nLet go my hands!\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why do you cast a shadow?\nWhere do you come from? Who brought you to this\nplace?\nThey would not send me one that casts a shadow.\nDectora\n. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,\nAnd drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,\nAnd blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,\nHad drowned me also.\u00a0 But, being yet alive,\nI ask a fitting punishment for all\nThat raised their hands against him.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are some\nThat weigh and measure all in these waste seas -\nThey that have all the wisdom that's in life,\nAnd all that prophesying images\nMade of dim gold rave out in secret tombs;\nThey have it that the plans of kings and queens\nBut laughter and tears - laughter, laughter, and tears;\nThat every man should carry his own soul\nUpon his shoulders.\nDectora.\nYou've nothing but wild words,\nAnd I would know if you will give me vengeance.\nForgael\n. When she finds out I will not let her go -\nWhen she knows that.\nDectora\n. What is it that you are muttering -\nThat you'll not let me go? I am a queen.\nForgael.\nAlthough you are more beautiful than any,\nI almost long that it were possible;\nBut if I were to put you on that ship,\nWith sailors that were sworn to do your will,\nAnd you had spread a sail for home, a wind\nWould rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge\nIt had washed among the stars and put them out,\nAnd beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,\nUntil you stood before me on the deck -\nAs now.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  Does wandering in these desolate seas\nAnd listening to the cry of wind and wave\nBring madness?\nForgael.\nQueen, I am not mad.\nDectora.\nYet say\nThat unimaginable storms of wind and wave\nWould rise against me.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No, I am not mad -\nIf it be not that hearing messages\nFrom lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,\nAt the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.\nDectora\n. And did those watchers bid you take me\ncaptive?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  Both you and I are taken in the net.\nIt was their hands that plucked the winds awake\nAnd blew you hither; and their mouths have\npromised\nI shall have love in their immortal fashion;\nAnd for this end they gave me my old harp\nThat is more mighty than the sun and moon,\nOr than the shivering casting-net of the stars,\nThat none might take you from me.\nDectora\n[first trembling back from the mast where the harp is,\nand then laughing]. For a moment\nYour raving of a message and a harp\nMore mighty than the stars half troubled me,\nBut all that's raving.\u00a0 Who is there can compel\nThe daughter and the granddaughter of kings\nTo be his bedfellow?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Until your lips\nHave called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.\nDectora\n. My husband and my king died at my feet,\nAnd yet you talk of love.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The movement of time\nIs shaken in these seas, and what one does\nOne moment has no might upon the moment\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I understand you now.\nYou have a Druid craft of wicked sound\nWrung from the cold women of the sea -\nA magic that can call a demon up,\nUntil my body give you kiss for kiss.\nForgael\n. Your soul shall give the kiss.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I am not afraid,\nWhile there's a rope to run into a noose\nOr wave to drown.\u00a0 But I have done with words,\nAnd I would have you look into my face\nAnd know that it is fearless.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Do what you will,\nFor neither I nor you can break a mesh\nOf the great golden net that is about us.\nDectora.\nThere's nothing in the world that's worth a\nfear.\n[She passes Forgael and stands for a moment looking into\nhis face.]\nI have good reason for that thought.\n[She runs suddenly on to the raised part of the poop.]\nAnd now\nI can put fear away as a queen should.\n[She mounts on to the hulwark and turns towards\nForgael.]\nFool, fool! Although you have looked into my face\nYou do not see my purpose.\u00a0 I shall have gone\nBefore a hand can touch me.\nForgael\n[folding his arms].\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My hands are still;\nThe Ever-living hold us.\u00a0 Do what you will,\nYou cannot leap out of the golden net.\nFirst Sailor\n. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon\nAnd measure out a course and bring us home,\nWe'll put this man to death.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I promise it.\nFirst Sailor\n.

He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,\nAnd set you dreaming.\nSecond Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  How can we have a wake\nWhen we have neither brown nor yellow ale?\nFirst Sailor\n. I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.\nThird Sailor\n.

Protect me now, gods that my people swear by.\n[Aibric has risen from the deck where he had fallen.\u00a0 He\nhas begun looking for his sword as if in a dream.]\nAibric\n. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand\nWhen I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!\n[He goes dreamily towards the sword, but Dectora runs at\nit and takes it up before he can reach it.]\nAibric\n[sleepily]. Queen, give it me.\nDectora.\nNo, I have need of it.\nAibric\n. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it.\nNow that he's dead I have no need of it,\nFor everything is gone.\nA Sailor\n[calling from the other ship]. Come hither, Aibric,\nAnd tell me who it is that we are waking.\nAibric\n[half to Dectora, half to himself]. What name had\nthat dead king? Arthur of Britain?\nNo, no - not Arthur.\u00a0 I remember now.\nIt was golden-armed Iollan, and he died\nBroken-hearted, having lost his queen\nThrough wicked spells.\u00a0 That is not all the tale,\nFor he was killed.\u00a0 O! O! O! O! O! O!\nFor golden-armed Iollan has been killed.\n[He goes out.]\n[While he has been speaking, and through part of what\nother ship.\u00a0 Dectora stands with the sword lifted in\nfront of Forgael.]\nDectora\n. I will end all your magic on the instant.\n[Her voice becomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword\nslowly, and finally lets it fall.\u00a0 She spreads out her hair.\nShe takes off her crown and lays it upon the deck.]\nThis sword is to lie beside him in the grave.\nIt was in all his battles.\u00a0 I will spread my hair,\nAnd wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,\nFor I have heard that he was proud and laughing,\nBlue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,\nAnd that he died a thousand years ago.\nO; O! O! O!\n[Forgael changes the tune.]\nBut no, that is not it.\nThey killed him at my feet.\u00a0 O! O! O! O!\nFor golden-armed Iollan that I loved-\nBut what is it that made me say I loved him?\nIt was that harper put it in my thoughts,\nBut it is true.\u00a0 Why did they run upon him,\nAnd beat the golden helmet with their swords?\nForgael\n. Do you not know me, lady? I am he\nThat you are weeping for.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No, for he is dead.\nO! O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.\nForgael\n. It was so given out, but I will prove\nThat the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy\nHave buried nothing but my golden arms.\nListen to that low-laughing string of the moon\nAnd you will recollect my face and voice,\nFor you have listened to me playing it\nThese thousand years.\n[He starts up, listening to the birds.\u00a0 The harp slips from\nhis hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks\nbehind him.]\nWhat are the birds at there?\nWhy are they all a-flutter of a sudden?\nWhat are you calling out above the mast?\nIf railing and reproach and mockery\nBecause I have awakened her to love\nBy magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:\nBeing driven on by voices and by dreams\nThat were clear messages from the Ever-living,\nI have done right.\u00a0 What could I but obey?\nAnd yet you make a clamour of reproach.\nDectora\n[laughing]. Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning\nThat I should keen him from the full of the moon\nTo the horn, and he be hale and hearty.\nForgael\n. How have I wronged her now that she is merry?\nBut no, no, no! your cry is not against me.\nYou know the counsels of the Ever-living,\nAnd all that tossing of your wings is joy,\nAnd all that murmuring's but a marriage-song;\nBut if it be reproach, I answer this:\nThere is not one among you that made love\nby any other means.\u00a0 You call it passion,\nConsideration, generosity;\nBut it was all deceit, and flattery\nTo win a woman in her own despite,\nFor love is war, and there is hatred in it;\nAnd if you say that she came willingly -\nDectora\n.

You turn away.\u00a0 Why do you turn away?\nAm I to fear the waves, or is the moon\nMy enemy?\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  I looked upon the moon,\nLonging to knead and pull it into shape\nThat I might lay it on your head as a crown.\nBut now it is your thoughts that wander away,\nFor you are looking at the sea.\u00a0 Do you not know\nHow great a wrong it is to let one's thought\nWander a moment when one is in love?\nover the sea, shading his eyes.]\nWhy are you looking at the sea?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Look there!\nDectora\n.

I cannot - I am going on to the end.\nAs for this woman, I think she is coming with me.\nAibric\n. The Ever-living have made you mad; but no,\nIt was this woman in her woman's vengeance\nThat drove you to it, and I fool enough\nTo fancy that she'd bring you home again.\n'Twas you that egged him to it, for you know\nThat he is being driven to his death.\nDectora\n. That is not true, for he has promised me\nAn unimaginable happiness.\nAibric\n.

I'll do it for his sake.\nDectora\n. No.\u00a0 Take this sword\nAnd cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael.\nAibric\n[half falling into the keen]. The yew-bough has been\nbroken into two,\nAnd all the birds are scattered - O! O! O!\nFarewell! farewell! [He goes out.]\nDectora\n.

Beloved, hav-\ning dragged the net about us,\nAnd knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;\nAnd that old harp awakens of itself\nTo cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,\nThat have had dreams for father, live in us.\nThe deck of an ancient ship.  At the right of the stage is the mast,\nwith a large square sail hiding a great deal of the sky and sea\non that side.  The tiller is at the left of the stage; it is a long oar\ncoming through an opening in the bulwark.  The deck rises in a\nseries of steps behind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves\noverhead.  When the play opens there are four persons upon the\ndeck.  Aibric stands by the tiller.
