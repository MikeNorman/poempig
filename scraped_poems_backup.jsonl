{"title": "4 Quartets 2: East Coker", "author": "T S Eliot", "text": "In my beginning is my end. In succession\nHouses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,\nIs an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.\nOld stone to new building, old timber to new fires,\nOld fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth\nWhich is already flesh, fur and faeces,\nBone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.\nHouses live and die: there is a time for building\nAnd a time for living and for generation\nAnd a time for the wind to break the loosened pane\nAnd to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots\nAnd to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.\nIn my beginning is my end. Now the light falls\nAcross the open field, leaving the deep lane\nShuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,\nWhere you lean against a bank while a van passes,\nAnd the deep lane insists on the direction\nInto the village, in the electric heat\nHypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light\nIs absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.\nThe dahlias sleep in the empty silence.\nWait for the early owl.\nIn that open field\nIf you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,\nOn a summer midnight, you can hear the music\nOf the weak pipe and the little drum\nAnd see them dancing around the bonfire\nThe association of man and woman\nIn daunsinge, signifying matrimonie\u2014\nA dignified and commodiois sacrament.\nTwo and two, necessarye coniunction,\nHolding eche other by the hand or the arm\nWhiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire\nLeaping through the flames, or joined in circles,\nRustically solemn or in rustic laughter\nLifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,\nEarth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth\nMirth of those long since under earth\nNourishing the corn. Keeping time,\nKeeping the rhythm in their dancing\nAs in their living in the living seasons\nThe time of the seasons and the constellations\nThe time of milking and the time of harvest\nThe time of the coupling of man and woman\nAnd that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.\nEating and drinking. Dung and death.\nDawn points, and another day\nPrepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind\nWrinkles and slides. I am here\nOr there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.\nWhat is the late November doing\nWith the disturbance of the spring\nAnd creatures of the summer heat,\nAnd snowdrops writhing under feet\nAnd hollyhocks that aim too high\nRed into grey and tumble down\nLate roses filled with early snow?\nThunder rolled by the rolling stars\nSimulates triumphal cars\nDeployed in constellated wars\nScorpion fights against the Sun\nUntil the Sun and Moon go down\nComets weep and Leonids fly\nHunt the heavens and the plains\nWhirled in a vortex that shall bring\nThe world to that destructive fire\nWhich burns before the ice-cap reigns.\nThat was a way of putting it\u2014not very satisfactory:\nA periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,\nLeaving one still with the intolerable wrestle\nWith words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.\nIt was not (to start again) what one had expected.\nWhat was to be the value of the long looked forward to,\nLong hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity\nAnd the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us\nOr deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,\nBequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?\nThe serenity only a deliberate hebetude,\nThe wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets\nUseless in the darkness into which they peered\nOr from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to us,\nAt best, only a limited value\nIn the knowledge derived from experience.\nThe knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,\nFor the pattern is new in every moment\nAnd every moment is a new and shocking\nValuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived\nOf that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.\nIn the middle, not only in the middle of the way\nBut all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,\nOn the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,\nAnd menaced by monsters, fancy lights,\nRisking enchantment. Do not let me hear\nOf the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,\nTheir fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,\nOf belonging to another, or to others, or to God.\nThe only wisdom we can hope to acquire\nIs the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.\nThe houses are all gone under the sea.\nThe dancers are all gone under the hill.\nIII\nO dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,\nThe vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,\nThe captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,\nThe generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,\nDistinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,\nIndustrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,\nAnd dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha\nAnd the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,\nAnd cold the sense and lost the motive of action.\nAnd we all go with them, into the silent funeral,\nNobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.\nI said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you\nWhich shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,\nThe lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed\nWith a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,\nAnd we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama\nAnd the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away\u2014\nOr as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations\nAnd the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence\nAnd you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen\nLeaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;\nOr when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing\u2014\nI said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope\nFor hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,\nFor love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith\nBut the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.\nWait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:\nSo the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.\nWhisper of running streams, and winter lightning.\nThe wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,\nThe laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy\nNot lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony\nOf death and birth.\nYou say I am repeating\nSomething I have said before. I shall say it again.\nShall I say it again? In order to arrive there,\nTo arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,\nYou must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy.\nIn order to arrive at what you do not know\nYou must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.\nIn order to possess what you do not possess\nYou must go by the way of dispossession.\nIn order to arrive at what you are not\nYou must go through the way in which you are not.\nAnd what you do not know is the only thing you know\nAnd what you own is what you do not own\nAnd where you are is where you are not.\nThe wounded surgeon plies the steel\nThat questions the distempered part;\nBeneath the bleeding hands we feel\nThe sharp compassion of the healer's art\nResolving the enigma of the fever chart.\nOur only health is the disease\nIf we obey the dying nurse\nWhose constant care is not to please\nBut to remind of our, and Adam's curse,\nThe whole earth is our hospital\nEndowed by the ruined millionaire,\nWherein, if we do well, we shall\nDie of the absolute paternal care\nThat will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.\nThe chill ascends from feet to knees,\nThe fever sings in mental wires.\nIf to be warmed, then I must freeze\nAnd quake in frigid purgatorial fires\nOf which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.\nThe dripping blood our only drink,\nThe bloody flesh our only food:\nIn spite of which we like to think\nThat we are sound, substantial flesh and blood\u2014\nAgain, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.\nSo here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years\u2014\nTwenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres\nTrying to use words, and every attempt\nIs a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure\nBecause one has only learnt to get the better of words\nFor the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which\nOne is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture\nIs a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate\nWith shabby equipment always deteriorating\nIn the general mess of imprecision of feeling,\nUndisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer\nBy strength and submission, has already been discovered\nOnce or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope\nTo emulate\u2014but there is no competition\u2014\nThere is only the fight to recover what has been lost\nAnd found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions\nThat seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.\nFor us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.\nHome is where one starts from. As we grow older\nThe world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated\nOf dead and living. Not the intense moment\nIsolated, with no before and after,\nBut a lifetime burning in every moment\nAnd not the lifetime of one man only\nBut of old stones that cannot be deciphered.\nThere is a time for the evening under starlight,\nA time for the evening under lamplight\n(The evening with the photograph album).\nLove is most nearly itself\nWhen here and now cease to matter.\nOld men ought to be explorers\nHere or there does not matter\nWe must be still and still moving\nInto another intensity\nFor a further union, a deeper communion\nThrough the dark cold and the empty desolation,\nThe wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters\nOf the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.\nThis poem is one of the famous \u201c4 Quartets\u201d they are:-\n1. Burnt Norton\nhttp://oldpoetry.com/opoem/11763\n2. East Coker\nhttp://oldpoetry.com/opoem/57176\n3.

Such the sun, the moon,\nTrees old, and young, sprouting a shady boon\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\nPouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\nNor do we merely feel these essences\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\nDear as the temple's self, so does the moon,\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast\nThat, whether there be shine or gloom o'ercast,\nThey always must be with us, or we die.\nTherefore, 'tis with full happiness that I\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\nThe very music of the name has gone\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\nOf our own valleys: so I will begin\nNow while I cannot hear the city's din;\nNow while the early budders are just new,\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimmed and white,\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\nI must be near the middle of my story.\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\nSee it half finished: but let Autumn bold,\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\nBe all about me when I make an end!\nAnd now at once, adventuresome, I send\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/A-Thing-Of-Beauty-"}
{"title": "Acrostic : Georgiana Augusta Keats", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Give me your patience, sister, while I frame\nExact in capitals your golden name;\nOr sue the fair Apollo and he will\nRouse from his heavy slumber and instill\nGreat love in me for thee and Poesy.\nImagine not that greatest mastery\nAnd kingdom over all the Realms of verse,\nNears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurse\nAnd surety give to love and Brotherhood.\nAnthropophagi in Othello's mood;\nUlysses storm'd and his enchanted belt\nGlow with the Muse, but they are never felt\nUnbosom'd so and so eternal made,\nSuch tender incense in their laurel shade\nTo all the regent sisters of the Nine\nAs this poor offering to you, sister mine.\nKind sister! aye, this third name says you are;\nEnchanted has it been the Lord knows where;\nAnd may it taste to you like good old wine,\nTake you to real happiness and give\nSons, daughters and a home like honied hive.\n'This acrostic seems to have been written at the foot of Helvellyn on the 27th of June 1818, for although it appears in the Winchester journal-letter of September 1819 as given in the New York World of the 25th of June 1877, it purports to be copied from an old letter which reached Liverpool after the George Keatses had sailed for America, and which was therefore returned to the poet.  The words \"Foot of Helvellyn, June 27th,\" are printed in The World as if they belonged to the next piece copied into the journal-letter; but the context indicates that the date really belongs to the acrostic. Keats (with his friend Charles Armitage Brown) was on the way to Carlisle, to take coach there for Dumfries and begin the walking tour in Scotland on which the first serious break-down of his health occurred. Leaving London about the middle of June, they had seen the George Keatses off from Liverpool for America, and had then started walking from Lancaster; so that, by the time Keats was writing the Acrostic, he had already been walking several days; and four days later the friends reached Carlisle, ending there the English portion of their walk.'\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

But he that gets their love after the fashion\n\"Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope\nAnd bodily tenderness, and finds that even\nThe bed of love, that in the imagination\nHad seemed to be the giver of all peace,\nIs no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,\nAnd as soon finished.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  All that ever loved\nHave loved that way - there is no other way.\nForgael\n. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they\nbelieved there was some other near at hand,\nAnd almost wept because they could not find it.\nAibric\n. When they have twenty years; in middle life\nThey take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,\nAnd let the dream go by.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's not a dream,\nBut the reality that makes our passion\nAs a lamp shadow - no - no lamp, the sun.\nWhat the world's million lips are thirsting for\nMust be substantial somewhere.\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I have heard the Druids\nMutter such things as they awake from trance.\nIt may be that the Ever-living know it -\nNo mortal can.\nForgael\nAibric\n. They are besotting you as they besot\nThe crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows\nThat he has been all night upon the hills,\nRiding to hurley, or in the battle-host\nWith the Ever-living.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What if he speak the truth,\nAnd for a dozen hours have been a part\nOf that more powerful life?\nAibric\n,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  His wife knows better.\nHas she not seen him lying like a log,\nOr fumbling in a dream about the house?\nAnd if she hear him mutter of wild riders,\nShe knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing\nThat set him to the fancy.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  All would be well\nCould we but give us wholly to the dreams,\nAnd get into their world that to the sense\nIs shadow, and not linger wretchedly\nAmong substantial things; for it is dreams\nThat lift us to the flowing, changing world\nThat the heart longs for.\u00a0 What is love itself,\nEven though it be the lightest of light love,\nBut dreams that hurry from beyond the world\nTo make low laughter more than meat and drink,\nThough it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,\nCould we but mix ourselves into a dream,\nNot in its image on the mirror!\nAibric\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While\nWe're in the body that's impossible.\nForgael\n. And yet I cannot think they're leading me\nTo death; for they that promised to me love\nAs those that can outlive the moon have known it, '\nHad the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,\nInto their shining limbs - I've had great teachers.\nAengus and Edain ran up out of the wave -\nYou'd never doubt that it was life they promised\nHad you looked on them face to face as I did,\nWith so red lips, and running on such feet,\nAnd having such wide-open, shining eyes.\nAibric\n. It's certain they are leading you to death.\nNone but the dead, or those that never lived,\nCan know that ecstasy.\u00a0 Forgael! Forgael!\nAnd you have told me that their journey lies\nTowards the country of the dead.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  What matter\nIf I am going to my death? - for there,\nOr somewhere, I shall find the love they have\npromised.\nThat much is certain.\u00a0 I shall find a woman.\nOne of the Ever-living, as I think -\nOne of the Laughing People - and she and I\nShall light upon a place in the world's core,\nWhere passion grows to be a changeless thing,\nLike charmed apples made of chrysoprase,\nOr chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysclite;\nAnd there, in juggleries of sight and sense,\nBecome one movement, energy, delight,\nUntil the overburthened moon is dead.\n[A number of Sailors enter hurriedly.]\nFirst Sailor\n. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice!\nAnd we are almost on her!\nSecond Sailor.\nWe had not known\nBut for the ambergris and sandalwood.\nFirst Sailor\n. NO; but opoponax and cinnamon.\nForgael\n[taking the tiller from Aibric]. The Ever-living have\nkept my bargain for me,\nAnd paid you on the nail.\nAibric\nTake up that rope\nTo make her fast while we are plundering her.\nFirst Sailor\n. There is a king and queen upon her deck,\nAnd where there is one woman there'll be others.\nAibric\n. Speak lower, or they'll hear.\nFirst Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  They cannot hear;\nThey are too busy with each other.\u00a0 Look!\nHe has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.\nSecond Sailor\n. When she finds out we have better men\naboard\nShe may not be too sorry in the end.\nFirst Sailor\n. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens\nCare more about the kegs of silver and gold\nAnd the high fame that come to them in marriage,\nThan a strong body and a ready hand.\nSecond Sailor.\nThere's nobody is natural but a robber,\nAnd that is why the world totters about\nUpon its bandy legs.\nAibric.\nRun at them now,\nAnd overpower the crew while yet asleep!\n[The Sailors go out.]\n[Voices and the clashing of swords are heard from the\nother ship, which cannot be seen because of the sail.]\nA Voice\n. Armed men have come upon us! O I am slain!\nAnother Voice.\nWake all below!\nAnother Voice\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 Why have you broken our sleep?\nFirst Voice\n. Armed men have come upon us! O I am\nslain!\nForgael\n[who has remained at the tiller]. There! there they\ncome! Gull, gannet, or diver,\nBut with a man's head, or a fair woman's,\nThey hover over the masthead awhile\nTo wait their Fiends; but when their friends have\ncome\nThey'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.\nOne - and one - a couple - five together;\nAnd I will hear them talking in a minute.\nYes, voices! but I do not catch the words.\nNow I can hear.\u00a0 There's one of them that says,\n\"How light we are, now we are changed to birds!'\nAnother answers, \"Maybe we shall find\nOur heart's desire now that we are so light.'\nAnd then one asks another how he died,\nAnd says, \"A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.-\nAnd now they all wheel suddenly and fly\nTo the other side, and higher in the air.\nAnd now a laggard with a woman's head\nComes crying, \"I have run upon the sword.\nI have fled to my beloved in the air,\nIn the waste of the high air, that we may wander\nAmong the windy meadows of the dawn.'\nBut why are they still waiting? why are they\nCircling and circling over the masthead?\nWhat power that is more mighty than desire\nTo hurry to their hidden happiness\nWithholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones\nA meaning in that circling overhead?\nBut what's the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you\nlinger there?\nWhy linger? Run to your desire,\nAre you not happy winged bodies now?\n[His voice sinks again.]\nBeing too busy in the air and the high air,\nThey cannot hear my voice; but what's the meaning?\n[The Sailors have returned.\u00a0 Dectora is with them.]\nForgael\n[turning and seeing her]. Why are you standing\nwith your eyes upon me?\nYou are not the world's core.\u00a0 O no, no, no!\nThat cannot be the meaning of the birds.\nYou are not its core.\u00a0 My teeth are in the world,\nBut have not bitten yet.\nDectora.\nI am a queen,\nAnd ask for satisfaction upon these\nWho have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.\n[Breaking loose from the Sailors who are holding her.]\nLet go my hands!\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why do you cast a shadow?\nWhere do you come from? Who brought you to this\nplace?\nThey would not send me one that casts a shadow.\nDectora\n. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,\nAnd drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,\nAnd blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,\nHad drowned me also.\u00a0 But, being yet alive,\nI ask a fitting punishment for all\nThat raised their hands against him.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are some\nThat weigh and measure all in these waste seas -\nThey that have all the wisdom that's in life,\nAnd all that prophesying images\nMade of dim gold rave out in secret tombs;\nThey have it that the plans of kings and queens\nBut laughter and tears - laughter, laughter, and tears;\nThat every man should carry his own soul\nUpon his shoulders.\nDectora.\nYou've nothing but wild words,\nAnd I would know if you will give me vengeance.\nForgael\n. When she finds out I will not let her go -\nWhen she knows that.\nDectora\n. What is it that you are muttering -\nThat you'll not let me go? I am a queen.\nForgael.\nAlthough you are more beautiful than any,\nI almost long that it were possible;\nBut if I were to put you on that ship,\nWith sailors that were sworn to do your will,\nAnd you had spread a sail for home, a wind\nWould rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge\nIt had washed among the stars and put them out,\nAnd beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,\nUntil you stood before me on the deck -\nAs now.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  Does wandering in these desolate seas\nAnd listening to the cry of wind and wave\nBring madness?\nForgael.\nQueen, I am not mad.\nDectora.\nYet say\nThat unimaginable storms of wind and wave\nWould rise against me.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No, I am not mad -\nIf it be not that hearing messages\nFrom lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,\nAt the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.\nDectora\n. And did those watchers bid you take me\ncaptive?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  Both you and I are taken in the net.\nIt was their hands that plucked the winds awake\nAnd blew you hither; and their mouths have\npromised\nI shall have love in their immortal fashion;\nAnd for this end they gave me my old harp\nThat is more mighty than the sun and moon,\nOr than the shivering casting-net of the stars,\nThat none might take you from me.\nDectora\n[first trembling back from the mast where the harp is,\nand then laughing]. For a moment\nYour raving of a message and a harp\nMore mighty than the stars half troubled me,\nBut all that's raving.\u00a0 Who is there can compel\nThe daughter and the granddaughter of kings\nTo be his bedfellow?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Until your lips\nHave called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.\nDectora\n. My husband and my king died at my feet,\nAnd yet you talk of love.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The movement of time\nIs shaken in these seas, and what one does\nOne moment has no might upon the moment\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I understand you now.\nYou have a Druid craft of wicked sound\nWrung from the cold women of the sea -\nA magic that can call a demon up,\nUntil my body give you kiss for kiss.\nForgael\n. Your soul shall give the kiss.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I am not afraid,\nWhile there's a rope to run into a noose\nOr wave to drown.\u00a0 But I have done with words,\nAnd I would have you look into my face\nAnd know that it is fearless.\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Do what you will,\nFor neither I nor you can break a mesh\nOf the great golden net that is about us.\nDectora.\nThere's nothing in the world that's worth a\nfear.\n[She passes Forgael and stands for a moment looking into\nhis face.]\nI have good reason for that thought.\n[She runs suddenly on to the raised part of the poop.]\nAnd now\nI can put fear away as a queen should.\n[She mounts on to the hulwark and turns towards\nForgael.]\nFool, fool! Although you have looked into my face\nYou do not see my purpose.\u00a0 I shall have gone\nBefore a hand can touch me.\nForgael\n[folding his arms].\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My hands are still;\nThe Ever-living hold us.\u00a0 Do what you will,\nYou cannot leap out of the golden net.\nFirst Sailor\n.

He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,\nAnd set you dreaming.\nSecond Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  How can we have a wake\nWhen we have neither brown nor yellow ale?\nFirst Sailor\n. I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.\nThird Sailor\n. How can we raise the keen that do not\nknow\nWhat name to call him by?\nFirst Sailor\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Come to his ship.\nHis name will come into our thoughts in a minute.\nI know that he died a thousand years ago,\nAnd has not yet been waked.\nSecond Sailor\n[beginning to keen]. Ohone! O! O! O!\nThe yew-bough has been broken into two,\nAnd all the birds are scattered.\nAll the Sailors.\nO! O! O! O!\n[They go out keening.]\nDectora\n. Protect me now, gods that my people swear by.\n[Aibric has risen from the deck where he had fallen.\u00a0 He\nhas begun looking for his sword as if in a dream.]\nAibric\n. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand\nWhen I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!\n[He goes dreamily towards the sword, but Dectora runs at\nit and takes it up before he can reach it.]\nAibric\n[sleepily]. Queen, give it me.\nDectora.\nNo, I have need of it.\nAibric\n. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it.\nNow that he's dead I have no need of it,\nFor everything is gone.\nA Sailor\n[calling from the other ship]. Come hither, Aibric,\nAnd tell me who it is that we are waking.\nAibric\n[half to Dectora, half to himself]. What name had\nthat dead king? Arthur of Britain?\nNo, no - not Arthur.\u00a0 I remember now.\nIt was golden-armed Iollan, and he died\nBroken-hearted, having lost his queen\nThrough wicked spells.\u00a0 That is not all the tale,\nFor he was killed.\u00a0 O! O! O! O! O! O!\nFor golden-armed Iollan has been killed.\n[He goes out.]\n[While he has been speaking, and through part of what\nother ship.\u00a0 Dectora stands with the sword lifted in\nfront of Forgael.]\nDectora\n. I will end all your magic on the instant.\n[Her voice becomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword\nslowly, and finally lets it fall.\u00a0 She spreads out her hair.\nShe takes off her crown and lays it upon the deck.]\nThis sword is to lie beside him in the grave.\nIt was in all his battles.\u00a0 I will spread my hair,\nAnd wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,\nFor I have heard that he was proud and laughing,\nBlue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,\nAnd that he died a thousand years ago.\nO; O! O! O!\n[Forgael changes the tune.]\nBut no, that is not it.\nThey killed him at my feet.\u00a0 O! O! O! O!\nFor golden-armed Iollan that I loved-\nBut what is it that made me say I loved him?\nIt was that harper put it in my thoughts,\nBut it is true.\u00a0 Why did they run upon him,\nAnd beat the golden helmet with their swords?\nForgael\n. Do you not know me, lady? I am he\nThat you are weeping for.\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  No, for he is dead.\nO! O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.\nForgael\n. It was so given out, but I will prove\nThat the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy\nHave buried nothing but my golden arms.\nListen to that low-laughing string of the moon\nAnd you will recollect my face and voice,\nFor you have listened to me playing it\nThese thousand years.\n[He starts up, listening to the birds.\u00a0 The harp slips from\nhis hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks\nbehind him.]\nWhat are the birds at there?\nWhy are they all a-flutter of a sudden?\nWhat are you calling out above the mast?\nIf railing and reproach and mockery\nBecause I have awakened her to love\nBy magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:\nBeing driven on by voices and by dreams\nThat were clear messages from the Ever-living,\nI have done right.\u00a0 What could I but obey?\nAnd yet you make a clamour of reproach.\nDectora\n[laughing]. Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning\nThat I should keen him from the full of the moon\nTo the horn, and he be hale and hearty.\nForgael\n. How have I wronged her now that she is merry?\nBut no, no, no! your cry is not against me.\nYou know the counsels of the Ever-living,\nAnd all that tossing of your wings is joy,\nAnd all that murmuring's but a marriage-song;\nBut if it be reproach, I answer this:\nThere is not one among you that made love\nby any other means.\u00a0 You call it passion,\nConsideration, generosity;\nBut it was all deceit, and flattery\nTo win a woman in her own despite,\nFor love is war, and there is hatred in it;\nAnd if you say that she came willingly -\nDectora\n. Why do you turn away and hide your face,\nThat I would look upon for ever?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  My grief!\nDectora\n.

I weep because I've nothing for your eyes\nBut desolate waters and a battered ship.\nDectora\n. O why do you not lift your eyes to mine?\nForgael\n. I weep - I weep because bare night's above,\nAnd not a roof of ivory and gold.\nDectora\n. I would grow jealous of the ivory roof,\nAnd strike the golden pillars with my hands.\nI would that there was nothing in the world\nBut my beloved - that night and day had perished,\nAnd all that is and all that is to be,\nAll that is not the meeting of our lips.\nForgael\n. You turn away.\u00a0 Why do you turn away?\nAm I to fear the waves, or is the moon\nMy enemy?\nDectora\n.\u00a0 \u00a0  I looked upon the moon,\nLonging to knead and pull it into shape\nThat I might lay it on your head as a crown.\nBut now it is your thoughts that wander away,\nFor you are looking at the sea.\u00a0 Do you not know\nHow great a wrong it is to let one's thought\nWander a moment when one is in love?\nover the sea, shading his eyes.]\nWhy are you looking at the sea?\nForgael\n.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Look there!\nDectora\n.

{"title": "Four Quartets 1: Burnt Norton", "author": "T S Eliot", "text": "Time present and time past\nAre both perhaps present in time future,\nAnd time future contained in time past.\nIf all time is eternally present\nAll time is unredeemable.\nWhat might have been is an abstraction\nRemaining a perpetual possibility\nOnly in a world of speculation.\nWhat might have been and what has been\nPoint to one end, which is always present.\nFootfalls echo in the memory\nDown the passage which we did not take\nTowards the door we never opened\nInto the rose-garden. My words echo\nThus, in your mind.\nBut to what purpose\nDisturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves\nI do not know.\nOther echoes\nQuick, said the bird, find them, find them,\nRound the corner. Through the first gate,\nThe deception of the thrush? Into our first world.\nThere they were, dignified, invisible,\nMoving without pressure, over the dead leaves,\nIn the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,\nAnd the bird called, in response to\nThe unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,\nAnd the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses\nHad the look of flowers that are looked at.\nThere they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.\nSo we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,\nAlong the empty alley, into the box circle,\nTo look down into the drained pool.\nDry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,\nAnd the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,\nAnd the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,\nThe surface glittered out of heart of light,\nAnd they were behind us, reflected in the pool.\nThen a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.\nGo, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,\nHidden excitedly, containing laughter.\nGo, go, go, said the bird: human kind\nCannot bear very much reality.\nTime past and time future\nWhat might have been and what has been\nPoint to one end, which is always present.\nGarlic and sapphires in the mud\nClot the bedded axle-tree.\nThe trilling wire in the blood\nSings below inveterate scars\nAppeasing long forgotten wars.\nThe dance along the artery\nThe circulation of the lymph\nAre figured in the drift of stars\nAscend to summer in the tree\nWe move above the moving tree\nIn light upon the figured leaf\nAnd hear upon the sodden floor\nBelow, the boarhound and the boar\nPursue their pattern as before\nBut reconciled among the stars.\nAt the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;\nNeither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,\nBut neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,\nWhere past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,\nNeither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,\nThere would be no dance, and there is only the dance.\nI can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.\nAnd I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.\nThe inner freedom from the practical desire,\nThe release from action and suffering, release from the inner\nAnd the outer compulsion, yet surrounded\nBy a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,\nErhebung without motion, concentration\nWithout elimination, both a new world\nAnd the old made explicit, understood\nIn the completion of its partial ecstasy,\nThe resolution of its partial horror.\nYet the enchainment of past and future\nWoven in the weakness of the changing body,\nProtects mankind from heaven and damnation\nWhich flesh cannot endure.\nTime past and time future\nAllow but a little consciousness.\nTo be conscious is not to be in time\nBut only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,\nThe moment in the arbour where the rain beat,\nThe moment in the draughty church at smokefall\nBe remembered; involved with past and future.\nOnly through time time is conquered.\nIII\nHere is a place of disaffection\nTime before and time after\nIn a dim light: neither daylight\nInvesting form with lucid stillness\nTurning shadow into transient beauty\nWith slow rotation suggesting permanence\nNor darkness to purify the soul\nEmptying the sensual with deprivation\nCleansing affection from the temporal.\nNeither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker\nOver the strained time-ridden faces\nDistracted from distraction by distraction\nFilled with fancies and empty of meaning\nTumid apathy with no concentration\nMen and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind\nThat blows before and after time,\nWind in and out of unwholesome lungs\nTime before and time after.\nEructation of unhealthy souls\nInto the faded air, the torpid\nDriven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,\nHampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,\nHighgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here\nNot here the darkness, in this twittering world.\nDescend lower, descend only\nInto the world of perpetual solitude,\nWorld not world, but that which is not world,\nInternal darkness, deprivation\nAnd destitution of all property,\nDesiccation of the world of sense,\nEvacuation of the world of fancy,\nInoperancy of the world of spirit;\nThis is the one way, and the other\nIs the same, not in movement\nBut abstention from movement; while the world moves\nIn appetency, on its metalled ways\nOf time past and time future.\nTime and the bell have buried the day,\nThe black cloud carries the sun away.\nWill the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis\nStray down, bend to us; tendril and spray\nClutch and cling?\nChill\nFingers of yew be curled\nDown on us? After the kingfisher's wing\nHas answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still\nAt the still point of the turning world.\nWords move, music moves\nOnly in time; but that which is only living\nCan only die. Words, after speech, reach\nInto the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,\nCan words or music reach\nThe stillness, as a Chinese jar still\nMoves perpetually in its stillness.\nNot the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,\nNot that only, but the co-existence,\nOr say that the end precedes the beginning,\nAnd the end and the beginning were always there\nBefore the beginning and after the end.\nAnd all is always now. Words strain,\nCrack and sometimes break, under the burden,\nUnder the tension, slip, slide, perish,\nDecay with imprecision, will not stay in place,\nWill not stay still. Shrieking voices\nScolding, mocking, or merely chattering,\nAlways assail them. The Word in the desert\nIs most attacked by voices of temptation,\nThe crying shadow in the funeral dance,\nThe loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.\nThe detail of the pattern is movement,\nAs in the figure of the ten stairs.\nDesire itself is movement\nNot in itself desirable;\nLove is itself unmoving,\nOnly the cause and end of movement,\nTimeless, and undesiring\nExcept in the aspect of time\nCaught in the form of limitation\nBetween un-being and being.\nSudden in a shaft of sunlight\nEven while the dust moves\nThere rises the hidden laughter\nOf children in the foliage\nQuick now, here, now, always\u2014\nRidiculous the waste sad time\nStretching before and after.\nThis poem is one of the famous \u201c4 Quartets\u201d they are:-\n1.

{"title": "Four Quartets 2: East Coker", "author": "T S Eliot", "text": "In my beginning is my end. In succession\nHouses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,\nIs an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.\nOld stone to new building, old timber to new fires,\nOld fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth\nWhich is already flesh, fur and faeces,\nBone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.\nHouses live and die: there is a time for building\nAnd a time for living and for generation\nAnd a time for the wind to break the loosened pane\nAnd to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots\nAnd to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.\nIn my beginning is my end. Now the light falls\nAcross the open field, leaving the deep lane\nShuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,\nWhere you lean against a bank while a van passes,\nAnd the deep lane insists on the direction\nInto the village, in the electric heat\nHypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light\nIs absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.\nThe dahlias sleep in the empty silence.\nWait for the early owl.\nIn that open field\nIf you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,\nOn a summer midnight, you can hear the music\nOf the weak pipe and the little drum\nAnd see them dancing around the bonfire\nThe association of man and woman\nIn daunsinge, signifying matrimonie\u2014\nA dignified and commodiois sacrament.\nTwo and two, necessarye coniunction,\nHolding eche other by the hand or the arm\nWhiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire\nLeaping through the flames, or joined in circles,\nRustically solemn or in rustic laughter\nLifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,\nEarth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth\nMirth of those long since under earth\nNourishing the corn. Keeping time,\nKeeping the rhythm in their dancing\nAs in their living in the living seasons\nThe time of the seasons and the constellations\nThe time of milking and the time of harvest\nThe time of the coupling of man and woman\nAnd that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.\nEating and drinking. Dung and death.\nDawn points, and another day\nPrepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind\nWrinkles and slides. I am here\nOr there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.\nWhat is the late November doing\nWith the disturbance of the spring\nAnd creatures of the summer heat,\nAnd snowdrops writhing under feet\nAnd hollyhocks that aim too high\nRed into grey and tumble down\nLate roses filled with early snow?\nThunder rolled by the rolling stars\nSimulates triumphal cars\nDeployed in constellated wars\nScorpion fights against the Sun\nUntil the Sun and Moon go down\nComets weep and Leonids fly\nHunt the heavens and the plains\nWhirled in a vortex that shall bring\nThe world to that destructive fire\nWhich burns before the ice-cap reigns.\nThat was a way of putting it\u2014not very satisfactory:\nA periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,\nLeaving one still with the intolerable wrestle\nWith words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.\nIt was not (to start again) what one had expected.\nWhat was to be the value of the long looked forward to,\nLong hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity\nAnd the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us\nOr deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,\nBequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?\nThe serenity only a deliberate hebetude,\nThe wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets\nUseless in the darkness into which they peered\nOr from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to us,\nAt best, only a limited value\nIn the knowledge derived from experience.\nThe knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,\nFor the pattern is new in every moment\nAnd every moment is a new and shocking\nValuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived\nOf that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.\nIn the middle, not only in the middle of the way\nBut all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,\nOn the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,\nAnd menaced by monsters, fancy lights,\nRisking enchantment. Do not let me hear\nOf the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,\nTheir fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,\nOf belonging to another, or to others, or to God.\nThe only wisdom we can hope to acquire\nIs the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.\nThe houses are all gone under the sea.\nThe dancers are all gone under the hill.\nIII\nO dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,\nThe vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,\nThe captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,\nThe generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,\nDistinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,\nIndustrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,\nAnd dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha\nAnd the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,\nAnd cold the sense and lost the motive of action.\nAnd we all go with them, into the silent funeral,\nNobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.\nI said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you\nWhich shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,\nThe lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed\nWith a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,\nAnd we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama\nAnd the bold imposing fa\u00e7ade are all being rolled away\u2014\nOr as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations\nAnd the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence\nAnd you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen\nLeaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;\nOr when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing\u2014\nI said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope\nFor hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,\nFor love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith\nBut the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.\nWait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:\nSo the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.\nWhisper of running streams, and winter lightning.\nThe wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,\nThe laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy\nNot lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony\nOf death and birth.\nYou say I am repeating\nSomething I have said before. I shall say it again.\nShall I say it again? In order to arrive there,\nTo arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,\nYou must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy.\nIn order to arrive at what you do not know\nYou must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.\nIn order to possess what you do not possess\nYou must go by the way of dispossession.\nIn order to arrive at what you are not\nYou must go through the way in which you are not.\nAnd what you do not know is the only thing you know\nAnd what you own is what you do not own\nAnd where you are is where you are not.\nThe wounded surgeon plies the steel\nThat questions the distempered part;\nBeneath the bleeding hands we feel\nThe sharp compassion of the healer's art\nResolving the enigma of the fever chart.\nOur only health is the disease\nIf we obey the dying nurse\nWhose constant care is not to please\nBut to remind of our, and Adam's curse,\nThe whole earth is our hospital\nEndowed by the ruined millionaire,\nWherein, if we do well, we shall\nDie of the absolute paternal care\nThat will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.\nThe chill ascends from feet to knees,\nThe fever sings in mental wires.\nIf to be warmed, then I must freeze\nAnd quake in frigid purgatorial fires\nOf which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.\nThe dripping blood our only drink,\nThe bloody flesh our only food:\nIn spite of which we like to think\nThat we are sound, substantial flesh and blood\u2014\nAgain, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.\nSo here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years\u2014\nTwenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres\nTrying to use words, and every attempt\nIs a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure\nBecause one has only learnt to get the better of words\nFor the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which\nOne is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture\nIs a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate\nWith shabby equipment always deteriorating\nIn the general mess of imprecision of feeling,\nUndisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer\nBy strength and submission, has already been discovered\nOnce or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope\nTo emulate\u2014but there is no competition\u2014\nThere is only the fight to recover what has been lost\nAnd found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions\nThat seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.\nFor us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.\nHome is where one starts from. As we grow older\nThe world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated\nOf dead and living. Not the intense moment\nIsolated, with no before and after,\nBut a lifetime burning in every moment\nAnd not the lifetime of one man only\nBut of old stones that cannot be deciphered.\nThere is a time for the evening under starlight,\nA time for the evening under lamplight\n(The evening with the photograph album).\nLove is most nearly itself\nWhen here and now cease to matter.\nOld men ought to be explorers\nHere or there does not matter\nWe must be still and still moving\nInto another intensity\nFor a further union, a deeper communion\nThrough the dark cold and the empty desolation,\nThe wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters\nOf the petrel and the porpoise.

{"title": "Four Quartets 3: The Dry Salvages", "author": "T S Eliot", "text": "I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river\nIs a strong brown god\u2014sullen, untamed and intractable,\nPatient to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier;\nUseful, untrustworthy, as a conveyor of commerce;\nThen only a problem confronting the builder of bridges.\nThe problem once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten\nBy the dwellers in cities\u2014ever, however, implacable.\nKeeping his seasons and rages, destroyer, reminder\nOf what men choose to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated\nBy worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and waiting.\nHis rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom,\nIn the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard,\nIn the smell of grapes on the autumn table,\nAnd the evening circle in the winter gaslight.\nThe river is within us, the sea is all about us;\nThe sea is the land's edge also, the granite\nInto which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses\nIts hints of earlier and other creation:\nThe starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's backbone;\nThe pools where it offers to our curiosity\nThe more delicate algae and the sea anemone.\nIt tosses up our losses, the torn seine,\nThe shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar\nAnd the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many voices,\nMany gods and many voices.\nThe salt is on the briar rose,\nThe fog is in the fir trees.\nThe sea howl\nAnd the sea yelp, are different voices\nOften together heard: the whine in the rigging,\nThe menace and caress of wave that breaks on water,\nThe distant rote in the granite teeth,\nAnd the wailing warning from the approaching headland\nAre all sea voices, and the heaving groaner\nRounded homewards, and the seagull:\nAnd under the oppression of the silent fog\nThe tolling bell\nMeasures time not our time, rung by the unhurried\nGround swell, a time\nOlder than the time of chronometers, older\nThan time counted by anxious worried women\nLying awake, calculating the future,\nTrying to unweave, unwind, unravel\nAnd piece together the past and the future,\nBetween midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception,\nThe future futureless, before the morning watch\nWhen time stops and time is never ending;\nAnd the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning,\nClangs\nThe bell.\nWhere is there an end of it, the soundless wailing,\nThe silent withering of autumn flowers\nDropping their petals and remaining motionless;\nWhere is there and end to the drifting wreckage,\nThe prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable\nPrayer at the calamitous annunciation?\nThere is no end, but addition: the trailing\nConsequence of further days and hours,\nWhile emotion takes to itself the emotionless\nYears of living among the breakage\nOf what was believed in as the most reliable\u2014\nAnd therefore the fittest for renunciation.\nThere is the final addition, the failing\nPride or resentment at failing powers,\nThe unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless,\nIn a drifting boat with a slow leakage,\nThe silent listening to the undeniable\nClamour of the bell of the last annunciation.\nWhere is the end of them, the fishermen sailing\nInto the wind's tail, where the fog cowers?\nWe cannot think of a time that is oceanless\nOr of an ocean not littered with wastage\nOr of a future that is not liable\nLike the past, to have no destination.\nWe have to think of them as forever bailing,\nSetting and hauling, while the North East lowers\nOver shallow banks unchanging and erosionless\nOr drawing their money, drying sails at dockage;\nNot as making a trip that will be unpayable\nFor a haul that will not bear examination.\nThere is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,\nNo end to the withering of withered flowers,\nTo the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,\nTo the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,\nThe bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely prayable\nPrayer of the one Annunciation.\nIt seems, as one becomes older,\nThat the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence\u2014\nOr even development: the latter a partial fallacy\nEncouraged by superficial notions of evolution,\nWhich becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning the past.\nThe moments of happiness\u2014not the sense of well-being,\nFruition, fulfilment, security or affection,\nOr even a very good dinner, but the sudden illumination\u2014\nWe had the experience but missed the meaning,\nIn a different form, beyond any meaning\nWe can assign to happiness. I have said before\nThat the past experience revived in the meaning\nIs not the experience of one life only\nBut of many generations\u2014not forgetting\nSomething that is probably quite ineffable:\nThe backward look behind the assurance\nOf recorded history, the backward half-look\nOver the shoulder, towards the primitive terror.\nNow, we come to discover that the moments of agony\n(Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding,\nHaving hoped for the wrong things or dreaded the wrong things,\nIs not in question) are likewise permanent\nWith such permanence as time has. We appreciate this better\nIn the agony of others, nearly experienced,\nInvolving ourselves, than in our own.\nFor our own past is covered by the currents of action,\nBut the torment of others remains an experience\nUnqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition.\nPeople change, and smile: but the agony abides.\nTime the destroyer is time the preserver,\nLike the river with its cargo of dead negroes, cows and chicken coops,\nThe bitter apple, and the bite in the apple.\nAnd the ragged rock in the restless waters,\nWaves wash over it, fogs conceal it;\nOn a halcyon day it is merely a monument,\nIn navigable weather it is always a seamark\nTo lay a course by: but in the sombre season\nOr the sudden fury, is what it always was.\nIII\nI sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant\u2014\nAmong other things\u2014or one way of putting the same thing:\nThat the future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray\nOf wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,\nPressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been opened.\nAnd the way up is the way down, the way forward is the way back.\nYou cannot face it steadily, but this thing is sure,\nThat time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.\nWhen the train starts, and the passengers are settled\nTo fruit, periodicals and business letters\n(And those who saw them off have left the platform)\nTheir faces relax from grief into relief,\nTo the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.\nFare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past\nInto different lives, or into any future;\nYou are not the same people who left that station\nOr who will arrive at any terminus,\nWhile the narrowing rails slide together behind you;\nAnd on the deck of the drumming liner\nWatching the furrow that widens behind you,\nYou shall not think 'the past is finished'\nOr 'the future is before us'.\nAt nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,\nIs a voice descanting (though not to the ear,\nThe murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)\n'Fare forward, you who think that you are voyaging;\nYou are not those who saw the harbour\nReceding, or those who will disembark.\nHere between the hither and the farther shore\nWhile time is withdrawn, consider the future\nAnd the past with an equal mind.\nAt the moment which is not of action or inaction\nYou can receive this: \"on whatever sphere of being\nThe mind of a man may be intent\nAt the time of death\"\u2014that is the one action\n(And the time of death is every moment)\nWhich shall fructify in the lives of others:\nAnd do not think of the fruit of action.\nFare forward.\nO voyagers, O seamen,\nYou who came to port, and you whose bodies\nWill suffer the trial and judgement of the sea,\nOr whatever event, this is your real destination.'\nSo Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna\nOn the field of battle.\nNot fare well,\nBut fare forward, voyagers.\nLady, whose shrine stands on the promontory,\nPray for all those who are in ships, those\nWhose business has to do with fish, and\nThose concerned with every lawful traffic\nAnd those who conduct them.\nRepeat a prayer also on behalf of\nWomen who have seen their sons or husbands\nSetting forth, and not returning:\nFiglia del tuo figlio,\nQueen of Heaven.\nAlso pray for those who were in ships, and\nEnded their voyage on the sand, in the sea's lips\nOr in the dark throat which will not reject them\nOr wherever cannot reach them the sound of the sea bell's\nPerpetual angelus.\nTo communicate with Mars, converse with spirits,\nTo report the behaviour of the sea monster,\nDescribe the horoscope, haruspicate or scry,\nObserve disease in signatures, evoke\nBiography from the wrinkles of the palm\nAnd tragedy from fingers; release omens\nBy sortilege, or tea leaves, riddle the inevitable\nWith playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams\nOr barbituric acids, or dissect\nThe recurrent image into pre-conscious terrors\u2014\nTo explore the womb, or tomb, or dreams; all these are usual\nPastimes and drugs, and features of the press:\nAnd always will be, some of them especially\nWhen there is distress of nations and perplexity\nWhether on the shores of Asia, or in the Edgware Road.\nMen's curiosity searches past and future\nAnd clings to that dimension. But to apprehend\nThe point of intersection of the timeless\nWith time, is an occupation for the saint\u2014\nNo occupation either, but something given\nAnd taken, in a lifetime's death in love,\nArdour and selflessness and self-surrender.\nFor most of us, there is only the unattended\nMoment, the moment in and out of time,\nThe distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,\nThe wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning\nOr the waterfall, or music heard so deeply\nThat it is not heard at all, but you are the music\nWhile the music lasts. These are only hints and guesses,\nIs prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.\nThe hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation.\nHere the impossible union\nOf spheres of existence is actual,\nHere the past and future\nAre conquered, and reconciled,\nWhere action were otherwise movement\nOf that which is only moved\nAnd has in it no source of movement\u2014\nDriven by d\u00e6monic, chthonic\nPowers. And right action is freedom\nFrom past and future also.\nFor most of us, this is the aim\nNever here to be realised;\nWho are only undefeated\nBecause we have gone on trying;\nWe, content at the last\nIf our temporal reversion nourish\n(Not too far from the yew-tree)\nThe life of significant soil.\nThis poem is one of the famous \u201c4 Quartets\u201d they are:-\n1.

{"title": "Four Quartets 4: Little Gidding", "author": "T S Eliot", "text": "Midwinter spring is its own season\nSempiternal though sodden towards sundown,\nSuspended in time, between pole and tropic.\nWhen the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,\nThe brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,\nIn windless cold that is the heart's heat,\nReflecting in a watery mirror\nA glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.\nAnd glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,\nStirs the dumb spirit: no wind, but pentecostal fire\nIn the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing\nThe soul's sap quivers. There is no earth smell\nOr smell of living thing. This is the spring time\nBut not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow\nIs blanched for an hour with transitory blossom\nOf snow, a bloom more sudden\nThan that of summer, neither budding nor fading,\nNot in the scheme of generation.\nWhere is the summer, the unimaginable\nZero summer?\nIf you came this way,\nTaking the route you would be likely to take\nFrom the place you would be likely to come from,\nIf you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges\nWhite again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.\nIt would be the same at the end of the journey,\nIf you came at night like a broken king,\nIf you came by day not knowing what you came for,\nIt would be the same, when you leave the rough road\nAnd turn behind the pig-sty to the dull facade\nAnd the tombstone. And what you thought you came for\nIs only a shell, a husk of meaning\nFrom which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled\nIf at all. Either you had no purpose\nOr the purpose is beyond the end you figured\nAnd is altered in fulfilment. There are other places\nWhich also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,\nOr over a dark lake, in a desert or a city\u2014\nBut this is the nearest, in place and time,\nNow and in England.\nIf you came this way,\nTaking any route, starting from anywhere,\nAt any time or at any season,\nIt would always be the same: you would have to put off\nSense and notion. You are not here to verify,\nInstruct yourself, or inform curiosity\nOr carry report. You are here to kneel\nWhere prayer has been valid. And prayer is more\nThan an order of words, the conscious occupation\nOf the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.\nAnd what the dead had no speech for, when living,\nThey can tell you, being dead: the communication\nOf the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.\nHere, the intersection of the timeless moment\nIs England and nowhere. Never and always.\nAsh on and old man's sleeve\nIs all the ash the burnt roses leave.\nDust in the air suspended\nMarks the place where a story ended.\nDust inbreathed was a house\u2014\nThe walls, the wainscot and the mouse,\nThe death of hope and despair,\nThis is the death of air.\nThere are flood and drouth\nOver the eyes and in the mouth,\nDead water and dead sand\nContending for the upper hand.\nThe parched eviscerate soil\nGapes at the vanity of toil,\nLaughs without mirth.\nThis is the death of earth.\nWater and fire succeed\nThe town, the pasture and the weed.\nWater and fire deride\nThe sacrifice that we denied.\nWater and fire shall rot\nThe marred foundations we forgot,\nOf sanctuary and choir.\nThis is the death of water and fire.\nIn the uncertain hour before the morning\nNear the ending of interminable night\nAt the recurrent end of the unending\nAfter the dark dove with the flickering tongue\nHad passed below the horizon of his homing\nWhile the dead leaves still rattled on like tin\nOver the asphalt where no other sound was\nBetween three districts whence the smoke arose\nI met one walking, loitering and hurried\nAs if blown towards me like the metal leaves\nBefore the urban dawn wind unresisting.\nAnd as I fixed upon the down-turned face\nThat pointed scrutiny with which we challenge\nThe first-met stranger in the waning dusk\nI caught the sudden look of some dead master\nWhom I had known, forgotten, half recalled\nBoth one and many; in the brown baked features\nThe eyes of a familiar compound ghost\nBoth intimate and unidentifiable.\nSo I assumed a double part, and cried\nAnd heard another's voice cry: 'What! are you here?'\nAlthough we were not. I was still the same,\nKnowing myself yet being someone other\u2014\nAnd he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed\nTo compel the recognition they preceded.\nAnd so, compliant to the common wind,\nToo strange to each other for misunderstanding,\nIn concord at this intersection time\nOf meeting nowhere, no before and after,\nWe trod the pavement in a dead patrol.\nI said: 'The wonder that I feel is easy,\nYet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak:\nI may not comprehend, may not remember.'\nAnd he: 'I am not eager to rehearse\nMy thoughts and theory which you have forgotten.\nThese things have served their purpose: let them be.\nSo with your own, and pray they be forgiven\nBy others, as I pray you to forgive\nBoth bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten\nAnd the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.\nFor last year's words belong to last year's language\nAnd next year's words await another voice.\nBut, as the passage now presents no hindrance\nTo the spirit unappeased and peregrine\nBetween two worlds become much like each other,\nSo I find words I never thought to speak\nIn streets I never thought I should revisit\nWhen I left my body on a distant shore.\nSince our concern was speech, and speech impelled us\nTo purify the dialect of the tribe\nAnd urge the mind to aftersight and foresight,\nLet me disclose the gifts reserved for age\nTo set a crown upon your lifetime's effort.\nFirst, the cold friction of expiring sense\nWithout enchantment, offering no promise\nBut bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit\nAs body and soul begin to fall asunder.\nSecond, the conscious impotence of rage\nAt human folly, and the laceration\nOf laughter at what ceases to amuse.\nAnd last, the rending pain of re-enactment\nOf all that you have done, and been; the shame\nOf motives late revealed, and the awareness\nOf things ill done and done to others' harm\nWhich once you took for exercise of virtue.\nThen fools' approval stings, and honour stains.\nFrom wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit\nWhere you must move in measure, like a dancer.'\nThe day was breaking. In the disfigured street\nHe left me, with a kind of valediction,\nAnd faded on the blowing of the horn.\nIII\nThere are three conditions which often look alike\nYet differ completely, flourish in the same hedgerow:\nAttachment to self and to things and to persons, detachment\nFrom self and from things and from persons; and, growing between them, indifference\nWhich resembles the others as death resembles life,\nBeing between two lives\u2014unflowering, between\nThe live and the dead nettle. This is the use of memory:\nFor liberation\u2014not less of love but expanding\nOf love beyond desire, and so liberation\nFrom the future as well as the past. Thus, love of a country\nBegins as attachment to our own field of action\nAnd comes to find that action of little importance\nThough never indifferent. History may be servitude,\nHistory may be freedom. See, now they vanish,\nThe faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved them,\nTo become renewed, transfigured, in another pattern.\nSin is Behovely, but\nAll shall be well, and\nAll manner of thing shall be well.\nIf I think, again, of this place,\nAnd of people, not wholly commendable,\nOf no immediate kin or kindness,\nBut of some peculiar genius,\nAll touched by a common genius,\nUnited in the strife which divided them;\nIf I think of a king at nightfall,\nOf three men, and more, on the scaffold\nAnd a few who died forgotten\nIn other places, here and abroad,\nAnd of one who died blind and quiet\nWhy should we celebrate\nThese dead men more than the dying?\nIt is not to ring the bell backward\nNor is it an incantation\nTo summon the spectre of a Rose.\nWe cannot revive old factions\nThese men, and those who opposed them\nAnd those whom they opposed\nAccept the constitution of silence\nAnd are folded in a single party.\nWhatever we inherit from the fortunate\nWe have taken from the defeated\nWhat they had to leave us\u2014a symbol:\nA symbol perfected in death.\nAnd all shall be well and\nAll manner of thing shall be well\nBy the purification of the motive\nIn the ground of our beseeching.\nThe dove descending breaks the air\nWith flame of incandescent terror\nOf which the tongues declare\nThe one discharge from sin and error.\nThe only hope, or else despair\nLies in the choice of pyre of pyre\u2014\nTo be redeemed from fire by fire.\nWho then devised the torment? Love.\nLove is the unfamiliar Name\nBehind the hands that wove\nThe intolerable shirt of flame\nWhich human power cannot remove.\nWe only live, only suspire\nConsumed by either fire or fire.\nWhat we call the beginning is often the end\nAnd to make and end is to make a beginning.\nThe end is where we start from. And every phrase\nAnd sentence that is right (where every word is at home,\nTaking its place to support the others,\nThe word neither diffident nor ostentatious,\nAn easy commerce of the old and the new,\nThe common word exact without vulgarity,\nThe formal word precise but not pedantic,\nThe complete consort dancing together)\nEvery phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,\nEvery poem an epitaph. And any action\nIs a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat\nOr to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.\nWe die with the dying:\nSee, they depart, and we go with them.\nWe are born with the dead:\nSee, they return, and bring us with them.\nThe moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree\nAre of equal duration. A people without history\nIs not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern\nOf timeless moments. So, while the light fails\nOn a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel\nHistory is now and England.\nWith the drawing of this Love and the voice of this\nCalling\nWe shall not cease from exploration\nAnd the end of all our exploring\nWill be to arrive where we started\nAnd know the place for the first time.\nThrough the unknown, unremembered gate\nWhen the last of earth left to discover\nIs that which was the beginning;\nAt the source of the longest river\nThe voice of the hidden waterfall\nAnd the children in the apple-tree\nNot known, because not looked for\nBut heard, half-heard, in the stillness\nBetween two waves of the sea.\nQuick now, here, now, always\u2014\nA condition of complete simplicity\n(Costing not less than everything)\nAnd all shall be well and\nAll manner of thing shall be well\nWhen the tongues of flame are in-folded\nInto the crowned knot of fire\nAnd the fire and the rose are one.\nThis poem is one of the famous \u201c4 Quartets\u201d they are:-\n1.

In the juvescence of the year\nCame Christ the tiger\nIn depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,\nTo be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\nAmong whispers; by Mr. Silvero\nWith caressing hands, at Limoges\nWho walked all night in the next room;\nBy Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\nBy Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\nShifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\nWho turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\nWeave the wind. I have no ghosts,\nAn old man in a draughty house\nUnder a windy knob.\nAfter such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\nHistory has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\nAnd issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\nGuides us by vanities. Think now\nShe gives when our attention is distracted\nAnd what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\nThat the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\nWhat's not believed in, or if still believed,\nIn memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\nInto weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with\nTill the refusal propagates a fear. Think\nNeither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\nAre fathered by our heroism. Virtues\nAre forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\nThese tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\nThe tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last\nWe have not reached conclusion, when I\nStiffen in a rented house. Think at last\nI have not made this show purposelessly\nAnd it is not by any concitation\nOf the backward devils.\nI would meet you upon this honestly.\nI that was near your heart was removed therefrom\nTo lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.\nI have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it\nSince what is kept must be adulterated?\nI have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:\nHow should I use it for your closer contact?\nThese with a thousand small deliberations\nProtract the profit of their chilled delirium,\nExcite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,\nWith pungent sauces, multiply variety\nIn a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,\nSuspend its operations, will the weevil\nDelay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled\nBeyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear\nIn fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits\nOf Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,\nWhite feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,\nAnd an old man driven by the Trades\nTo a sleepy corner.\nTenants of the house,\nThoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8453701-Gerontion-by-T-S-Eliot"}

etherised upon a table;\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\nThe muttering retreats\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\nAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\nOf insidious intent\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question \u2026\nOh, do not ask, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nLet us go and make our visit.\nIn the room the women come and go\nTalking of Michelangelo.\nThe yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.\nAnd indeed there will be time\nFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\nRubbing its back upon the window-panes;\nThere will be time, there will be time\nTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\nThere will be time to murder and create,\nAnd time for all the works and days of hands\nThat lift and drop a question on your plate;\nTime for you and time for me,\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\nIn the room the women come and go\nTalking of Michelangelo.\nAnd indeed there will be time\nTo wonder, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d and, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair\u2014\nThey will say: \u201cHow his hair is growing thin!\u201d\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\u2014\nThey will say: \u201cBut how his

and white and bare\nBut in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!\nIt is perfume from a dress\nThat makes me so digress?\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\nAnd should I then presume?\nAnd how should I begin?\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?\u2026\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\nSmoothed by long fingers,\nAsleep \u2026 tired \u2026 or it malingers,\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\nThough I have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter,\nI am no prophet\u2014and here\u2019s no great matter;\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\nWould it have been worth while,\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,\nTo say: \u201cI am Lazarus, come from the dead,\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\u201d\u2014\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head,\nShould say: \u201cThat is not what I

I meant, at all.\u201d\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous\u2014\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\nI grow old \u2026 I grow old \u2026\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\nShall I part my hair behind?

{"title": "Fireflies", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore", "text": "My fancies are fireflies, \u2014\nSpecks of living light\ntwinkling in the dark.\nhe voice of wayside pansies,\nthat do not attract the careless glance,\nmurmurs in these desultory lines.\nIn the drowsy dark caves of the mind\ndreams build their nest with fragments\ndropped from day's caravan.\nSpring scatters the petals of flowers\nthat are not for the fruits of the future,\nbut for the moment's whim.\nJoy freed from the bond of earth's slumber\nrushes into numberless leaves,\nand dances in the air for a day.\nMy words that are slight\nmy lightly dance upon time's waves\nwhen my works havy with import have gone down.\nMind's underground moths\ngrow filmy wings\nand take a farewell flight\nin the sunset sky.\nThe butterfly counts not months but moments,\nand has time enough.\nMy thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises,\ncarrying a single laughter.\nThe tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow\nwhich yet it never can grasp.\nLet my love, like sunlight, surround you\nand yet give you illumined freedom.\nDays are coloured vbubbles\nthat float upon the surface of fathomless night.\nMy offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance,\nand therefore you may remember them.\nLeave out my name from the gift\nif it be a burden,\nbut keep my song.\nApril, like a child,\nwipes them away and forgets.\nMemory, the priestess,\nkills the present\nand offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.\nFrom the solemn gloom of the temple\nchildren run out to sit in the dust,\nGod watches them play\nand forgets the priest.\nMy mind starts up at some flash\non the flow of its thoughts\nlike a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own\nthat is never repeated.\nIn the mountain, stillness surges up\nto explore its own height;\nin the lake, movement stands still\nto contemplate its own depth.\nThe departing night's one kiss\non the closed eyes of morning\nglows in the star of dawn.\nMaiden, thy beauty is like a fruit\nwhich is yet to mature,\ntense with an unyielding secret.\nSorrow that has lost its memory\nis like the dumb dark hours\nthat have no bird songs\nbut only the cricket's chirp.\nBigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand\nwith a grip that kills it.\nWishing to hearten a timid lamp\ngreat night lights all her stars.\nThough he holds in his arms the earth-bride,\nthe sky is ever immensely away.\nGod seeks comrades and claims love,\nthe Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.\nThe soil in return for her service\nkeeps the tree tied to her,\nthe sky asks nothing and leaves it free.\nJewel-like immortal\ndoes not boast of its length of years\nbut of the scintillating point of its moment.\nThe child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,\nunobscured by the dust of history.\nAlight laughter in the steps of creation\ncarries it swiftly across time.\nOne who was distant came near to me in the morning,\nand still nearer when taken away by night.\nWhite and pink oleanders meet\nand make merry in different dialects.\nWhen peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.\nThe lake lies low by the hill,\na tearful entreaty of love\nat the foot of the inflexible.\nThere smiles the Divine Child\namong his playthings of unmeaning clouds\nand ephemeral lights and shadows.\nThe breeze whispers to the lotus,\n\"What is thy secret?\"\n\"It is myself,\" says the lotus,\n\"Steal it and I disappear!\"\nThe freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem\njoin hands in the dance of swaying branches.\nThe jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.\nThe tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom\nand yet to keep it for himself.\nGods, tired of their paradise, envy man.\nClouds are hills in vapour,\nhills are clouds in stone, \u2014\na phantasy in time's dream.\nWhile God waits for His temple to be built of love,\nmen bring stones.\nI touch God in my song\nas the hill touches the far-away sea\nwith its waterfall.\nLight finds her treasure of colours\nthrough the antagonism of clouds.\nMy heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears\nlike a wet tree glistening in the sun\nafter the rain is over.\nI have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,\nbut have failed to remember the grass\nthat has ever kept it green.\nThe one without second is emptiness,\nthe other one makes it true.\nLife's errors cry for the merciful beauty\nthat can modulate their isolation\ninto a harmony with the whole.\nThey expect thanks for the banished nest\nbecause their cage is shapely and secure.\nIn love I pay my endless debt to thee\nfor what thou art.\nThe pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,\nand the sun says, they are good.\nYour calumny against the great is impious,\nit hurts yourself;\nagainst the small it is mean,\nfor it hurts the victim.\nThe first flower that blossomed on this earth\nwas an invitation to the unborn song.\nDawn\u2014the many-coloured flower\u2014fades,\nand then the simple light-fruit,\nthe sun appears.\nThe muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom\nthrottles the voice that would cry.\nThe wind tries to take the flame by storm\nonly to blow it out.\nLife's play is swift,\nLife's playthings fall behind one by one\nand are forgotten.\nMy flower, seek not thy paradise\nin a fool's buttonhole.\nThou hast risen late, my crescent moon,\nbut my night bird is still awake to greet thee.\nDarkness is the veiled bride\nsilently waiting for the errant light\nto return to her bosom.\nTrees are the earth's endless effort to\nspeak to the listening heaven.\nThe burden of self is lightened\nwhen I laugh at myself.\nThe weak can be terrible\nbecause they try furiously to appear strong.\nThe wind of heaven blows,\nThe anchor desperately clutches the mud,\nand my boat is beating its breast against the chain.\nThe spirit of death is one,\nthe spirit of life is many,\nWhe God is dead religion becomes one.\nThe blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,\nthe wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\"\nDay's pain muffled by its own glare,\nburns among stars in the night.\nThe stars crowd round the virgin night\nin silent awe at her loneliness\nthat can never be touched.\nThe cloud gives all its gold\nto the departing sun\nand greets the rising moon\nwith only a pale smile.\nHe who does good comes to the temple gate,\nhe who loves reaches the shrine.\nFlower, have pity for the worm,\nit is not a bee,\nits love is a blunder and a burden.\nWith the ruins of terror's triumph\nchildren build their doll's house.\nThe lamp waits through the long day of neglect\nfor the flame's kiss in the night.\nFeathers in the dust lying lazily content\nhave forgotten their sky.\nThe flowers which is single\nneed not envy the thorns\nthat are numerous.\nThe world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny\nof its well-wisher.\nWe gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price\nfor our right to live.\nYour careless gifts of a moment,\nlike the meteors of an autumn night,\ncatch fire in the depth of my being.\nThe faith waiting in the heart of a seed\npromises a miracle of life\nwhich it cannot prove at once.\nSpring hesitates at winter's door,\nbut the mango blossom rashly runs our to him\nbefore her time and meets her doom.\nThe world is the ever-changing foam\nthet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.\nThe two separated shores mingle their voices\nin a song of unfathomed tears.\nAs a river in the sea,\nwork finds its fulfilment\nin the depth of leisure.\nI lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,\nbut the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.\nThy shy little pomegranate bud,\nblushing to-day behind her veil,\nwill burst into a passionate flower\nto-morrow when I am away.\nThe clumsiness of power spoils the key,\nand uses the pickaxe.\nBirth is from the mystery of night\ninto the grerater mystery of day.\nThese paper boats of mine are meant to dance\non the ripples of hours,\nand not to reach any destination.\nMigratory songs wing from my heart\nand seek their nests in your voice of love.\nThe sea of danger, doubt and denial\naround man's little island of certainty\nchallenges him to dare the unknown.\nLove punishes when it forgives,\nand injured beauty by its awful silence.\nYou live alone and unrecompensed\nbecause they are afraid of your great worth.\nThe same sun is newly born in new lands\nin a ring of endless dawns.\nGod is world is ever renewed by death,\na Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.\nThe glow-worm while exploring the dust\nnever knows that stars are in the sky.\nThe tree is of to-day, the flower is old,\nit brings with it the message\nof the immemorial seed.\nEach rose that comes brings me greetings\nfrom the Rose of an eternal spring.\nGod honours me when I work,\nHe loves me when I sing.\nMy love of to-day finds no home\nin the nest deserted by yesterday's love.\nThe fire of pain tracse for my soul\na luminous path across her sorrow.\nThe grass survives the hill\nthrough its resurrections from countless deaths.\nThou hast vanished from my reach\nleaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,\nan invisible image in the wind moving\namong the shadows.\nIn pity for the desolate branch\nspring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.\nThe shy shadow in the farden\nloves the sun in silence,\nFlowers guess the secret, and mile,\nwhile the leaves whisper.\nI leave no trace of wings in the air,\nbut I am glad I have had my flight.\nThe fireflies, twinkling among leaves,\nmake the stars wonder.\nThe mountain remains unmoved\nat its seeming defeat by the mist.\nWhile the rose said to the sun,\n\"I shall ever remember thee,\"\nher petals fell to the dust.\nHills are the earth's gesture of despair\nfor the unreachable.\nThough the thorn in thy flower pricked me,\nO Beauty,\nI am grateful.\nThe world knows that the few\nare more than the many.\nLet not my love be a burden on you, my friend,\nknow that it pays itself.\nDawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness,\nand is content to vanish when the sun comes out.\nBeauty is truth's smile\nwhen she beholds her own face\nin a perfect mirror.\nThe dew-drop knows the sun\nonly within its own tiny orb.\nForlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,\nswarming in the air, hum round my heart\nand seek my voice.\nThe desert is imprisoned in the wall\nof its unbounded barrenness.\nIn the thrill of little leaves\nI see the air's invisible dance,\nand in their glimmering\nthe secret heart-beats of the sky.\nYou are like a flowering tree,\namazed when I praise you for your gifts.\nThe earth's sacrifical fire\nflames up in her trees,\nscattering sparks in flowers.\nForetsts, the clouds of earth,\nhold up to the sky their silence,\nand clouds from above come down\nin resonant showers.\nThe world speaks to me in pictures,\nmy soul answers in music.\nThe sky tells its beads all night\non the countless stars\nin memory of the sun.\nThe darkness of night, like pain, is dumb,\nthe darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.\nPride engraves his frowns in stones,\nloe offers her surrender in flowers.\nThe obsequious brush curtails truth\nin diference to the canvas which is narrow.\nThe hill in its longing for the far-away sky\nwishes to be like the cloud\nwith its endless urge of seeking.\nTo justify their own spilling of ink\nthey spell the day as night.\nProfit smiles on goodness\nwhen the good is profitable.\nIn its swelling pride\nthe bubble doubts the turth of the sea,\nand laughs and bursts into emptiness.\nLove is an endless mystery,\nfor it has nothing else to explain its.\nMy clouds, sorrowing in the dark,\nforget that they themselves\nhave hidden the sun.\nMan discovers his own wealth\nwhen God comes to ask gifts of him.\nYou leave your memory as a flame\nto my lonely lamp of separation.\nI came to offer thee a flower,\nbut thou must have all my garden,\u2014\nIt is thine.\nThe picture\u2014a memory of light\ntreasured by the shadow.\nIt is easy to make faces at the sun,\nHe is exposed by his own light in all\ndirections.\nHistory slowly smothers its truth,\nbut hastily struggles to revive it\nin the terrible penance of pain.\nMy work is rewarded in daily wages,\nI wait for my final value in love.\nBeauty knows to say, \"Enough,\"\nbarbarism clamours for still more.\nGod loves to see in me, not his servant,\nbut himself who serves all.\nThe darkness of night is in harmony with day,\nthe morning of mist is discordant.\nIn the bounteous time of roses love is wine,\u2014\nit is food in the famished hour\nwhen their petals are shed.\nAn unknown flower in a strange land\nspeaks to the poet:\n\"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"\nI am able to love my God\nbecause He gives me freedom to deny Him.\nMy untuned strings beg for music\nin their anguished cry of shame.\nThe worm thinks it strange and foolish\nthat man does not eat his books.\nThe clouded sky to-day bears the visior\nof the shadow of a divine sadness\non the forehead of brooding eternity.\nThe shade of my tree is for passers-by,\nits fruit for the one for whom I wait.\nFlushed with the glow of sunset\nearth seems like a ripe fruit\nready to be harvested by night.\nLight accepts darkness for his spouse\nfor the sake of creation.\nThe reed waits for his master's breath,\nthe Master goes seeking for his reed.\nits writing unmeaning.\nThe sea smites his own barren breast\nbecause he has no flowers to offer to the moon.\nThe greed for fruit misses the flower.\nGod in His temple of stars\nwaits for man to bring him his lamp.\nThe fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.\nReleased from bonds, the shameless flame\ndies in barren ashes.\nThe sky sets no snare to capture the moon,\nit is her own freedom which binds her.\nThe light that fills the sky\nseeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.\nWealth is the burden of bigness,\nWelfare the fulness of being.\nThe razor-blade is proud of its keenness\nwhen it sneers at the sun.\nThe butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,\nnot the bee busily storing honey.\nChild, thou bringest to my heart\nthe babble of the wind and the water,\nthe flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,\nthe mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.\nThe rainbow among the clouds may be great\nbut the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.\nThe mist weaves her net round the morning,\ncaptivates him, and makes him blind.\nThe Morning Star whispers to Dawn,\n\"Tell me that you are only for me.\"\n\"Yes,\" she answers,\n\"And also only for that nameless flower.\"\nThe sky remains infinitely vacant\nfor earth there to build its heaven with dreams.\nPerhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt\nat being told that it is a fragment\nawaiting perfection.\nLet the evening forgive the mistakes of the day\nand thus win peace for herself.\nBeauty smiles in the confinement of the bud,\nin the heart of a sweet incompleteness.\nYour flitting love lightly brushed with its wings\nmy sun-flower\nand never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.\nLeaves are silences\naround flowers which are their words.\nThe tree bears its thousand years\nas one large majestic moment.\nMy offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road,\nbut for the wayside shrines\nthat surprise me at every bend.\nHour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower,\nis simple and inexplicable.\nDeath laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated\nthe breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.\nTruth loves its limits,\nfor there it meets the beautiful.\nBetween the shores of Me and Thee\nthere is the loud ocean, my own surging self,\nwhich I long to cross.\nThe right to possess boasts foolishly\nof its right to enjoy.\nThe rose is a great deal more\nthan a blushing apology for the thorn.\nDay offers to the silence of stars\nhis golden lute to be tuned\nfor the endless life.\nThe wise know how to teach,\nthe fool how to smite.\nThe centre is still and silent in the heart\nof an enternal dance of circles.\nThe judge thinks that he is just when he compares\nThe oil of another's lamp\nwith the light of his own.\nThe captive flower in the King's wreath\nsmiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.\nits outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.\nListen to the prayer of the forest\nfor its freedom in flowers.\nLet your love see me\neven through the barrier of nearness.\nThe spirit of work in creation is there\nTo carry the burden of the insturment,\ncount the cost of its material,\nand never to know that it is for music,\nis the tragedy of deaf life.\nFaith is the bird that feels the light\nand sings when the dawn is still dark.\nI bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup,\nto be cleansed with thy cool darkness\nfor a new morning's festival.\nThe mountain fir, in its rustling,\nmodulates the memory of its fights with the storm\ninto a hymn of peace.\nGod honoured me with his fight\nwhen I was rebellious,\nHe ignored me when I was languid.\nThe sectarina thinks\nthat he has the sea\nladled into his private pond.\nIn the shady depth of life\nare the lonely nests of memories\nthat shrink from words.\nLet my love find its strength\nin the service of day,\nits peace in the union of night.\nLife sends up in blades of grass\nits silent hymn of praise\nto the unnamed Light.\nThe stars of night are to me\nthe memorials of my day's faded flowers.\nOpen thy door to that which must go,\nfor the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.\nTrue end is not in the reaching of the limit,\nbut in a completion which is limitless.\nThe shore whispers to the sea:\nand wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.\nLet the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings\nand make the music thine and mine.\nThe inner world rounded in my life like a fruit,\nmatured in joy and sorrow,\nwill drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil\nfor some further course of creation.\nForm is in Matter, rhythm in Force,\nmeaning in the Person.\nThere are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth,\nI seek thy company so that I may sing.\nAs the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth,\nlet my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.\nMy faith in truth, my vision of the perfect,\nAll the delights that I have felt\nin life's fruits and flowers\nlet me offer to thee at the end of the feast,\nin a perfect union of love.\nSome have thought deeply and explored the\nmeaning of thy truth,\nand they are great;\nI have listened to catch the music of thy play,\nand I am glad.\nThe tree is a winged spirit\nreleased from the bondage of seed,\npursuing its adventure of life\nacross the unknown.\nThe lotus offers its beauty to the heaven,\nthe grass its service to the earth.\nThe sun's kiss mellows into abandonment\nthe miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.\nThe flame met the earthen lamp in me,\nand what a great marvel of light!\nMistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth\nand therefore delude us.\nThe cloud laughed at the rainbow\nsaying that is was an upstart\ngaudy in its emptiness.\nThe rainbow calmly answered,\n\"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"\nLet me not grope in vain in the dark\nbut keep my mind still in the faith\nthat the day will break\nand truth will appear\nin its simplicity.\nThrough the silent night\nI hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning\nknock at my heart.\nMy new love comes\nbringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.\nThe earth gazes at the moon and wonders\nthat she sould have all her music in her smile.\nDay with its glare of curiosity\nputs the stars to flight.\nMy mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky,\nat the window which is mine own,\nand not in the open\nwhere thou hast thy sole kingdom.\nMan claims God's flowers as his own\nwhen he weaves them in a garland.\nThe buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age,\nis ashamed that is has lost all its song.\nLike my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning,\nthe sun's rays robed in dark\nhide themselves under the ground.\nLike my heart'spain at love's sudden touch,\nthey change their veil at the spring's call\nand come out in the carnival of colours,\nin flowers and leaves.\nMy life's empty flute\nwaits for its final music\nlike the primal darkness\nbefore the stars came out.\nEmancipation from the bondage of the soil\nis no freedom for the tree.\nThe tapestry of life's story is woven\nwith the threads of life's ties\never joining and breaking.\nThose thoughts of mine that are never captured by words\nperch upon my song and dance.\nMy soul to-night loses itself\nin the silent heart of a tree\nstanding alone among the whispers of immensity.\nPearl shells cast up by the sea\non death's barren beach,\u2014\na magnificent wastefulness of creative life.\nThe sunlight opens for me the word's gate,\nlove's light its terasure.\nMy life like the reed with ist stops,\nhas its play od colours\nthrough the gaps in its hopes and gains.\nLet not my thanks to thee\nrob my silence of its fuller homage.\nLife's aspirations come\nin the guise of children.\nThe faded flower sighs\nthat the spring has vanished for ever.\nIn my life's garden\nmy wealth has been of the shadows and lights\nThe fruit that I Have gained for ever\nis thet which thou hast accepted.\nThe jasmine knows the sun to be her brother\nin the heaven.\nLight is young, the ancient light;\nshadows are of the moment, they are born old.\nI feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end\nwill brong me across to the other shore\nfrom where I shall see.\nThe butterfly flitting from flower to flower\never remains mine,\nI lose the one that is netted by me.\nYour voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest,\nand my drowsy wings dream\nof a voyage to the light\nabove the clouds.\nI miss the meaning of my own part\nin the play of life\nbecause I know not of the parts\nthat others play.\nThe flower sheds all its petals\nand finds the fruit.\nI leave my songs behind me\nto the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles\nand the joy of the wind from the south.\nDead leaves when they lose themselves in soil\ntake part in the life of the forest.\nThe mind ever seeks its words\nfrom its sounds and silence\nas the sky from its darkness and light.\nThe unseen dark plays on his flute\nand the rhythm of light\neddies into stars and suns,\ninto thoughts and reams.\nMy songs are to sing\nthat I have loved Thy singing.\nWhen the voice of the Silent touches my words\nI know him and therefore I know myself.\nMy last salutations are to them\nwho knew me imperfect and loved me.\nLove's gift cannot be given,\nit waits to be accepted.\nWhen death comes and whispers to me,\n\"Thy days are ended,\"\nlet me say to him, \"I have lived in love\nand not in mere time.\"\nHe will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\"\nI shall say, \"I know not, but this I know\nthat often when I sang I found my eternity.\"\n\"Let me light my lamp,\"\nsay the star,\n'and never debate\nBefore the end of my journey\nmay I reach within myself\nthe one which is the all,\nleaving the outer shell\nto float away with the drifting multitude\nupon the current of chance and change.\n\u00a9 by owner.

{"title": "Gitanjali", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore", "text": "Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.\nThis little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.\nAt the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.\nThy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.\nWhen thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.\nAll that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony - and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea.\nI know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence.\nI touch by the edge of the far-spreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach.\nDrunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.\nI know not how thou singest, my master! I ever listen in silent amazement.\nThe light of thy music illumines the world. The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky. The holy stream of thy music breaks through all stony obstacles and rushes on.\nMy heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice. I would speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled. Ah, thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music, my master!\nLife of my life, I shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing that thy living touch is upon all my limbs.\nI shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind.\nI shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart.\nAnd it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act.\nI ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards.\nAway from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil.\nToday the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove.\nNow it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure.\nPluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it droop and drop into the dust.\nI may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of pain from thy hand and pluck it. I fear lest the day end before I am aware, and the time of offering go by.\nThough its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower in thy service and pluck it while there is time.\nMy song has put off her adornments. She has no pride of dress and decoration. Ornaments would mar our union; they would come between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.\nMy poet's vanity dies in shame before thy sight. O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet. Only let me make my life simple and straight, like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.\nThe child who is decked with prince's robes and who has jewelled chains round his neck loses all pleasure in his play; his dress hampers him at every step.\nIn fear that it may be frayed, or stained with dust he keeps himself from the world, and is afraid even to move.\nMother, it is no gain, thy bondage of finery, if it keeps one shut off from the healthful dust of the earth, if it rob one of the right of entrance to the great fair of common human life.\nO Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! O beggar, to come beg at thy own door!\nLeave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look behind in regret.\nThy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath. It is unholy - take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. Accept only what is offered by sacred love.\n10.\nHere is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.\nWhen I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.\nPride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.\nMy heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest, the lowliest, and the lost.\n11.\nLeave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!\nHe is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. He is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. Put of thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!\nDeliverance? Where is this deliverance to be found? Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; he is bound with us all for ever.\nCome out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow.\n12.\nThe time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.\nI came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet.\nIt is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.\nThe traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end.\nMy eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said 'Here art thou!'\nThe question and the cry 'Oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance 'I am!'\n13.\nThe song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day. I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.\nThe time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart.\nThe blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.\nThe livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house.\nI live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.\n14.\nMy desires are many and my cry is pitiful, but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through.\nDay by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked - this sky and the light, this body and the life and the mind - saving me from perils of overmuch desire.\nThere are times when I languidly linger and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal; but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me.\nDay by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.\n15.\nI am here to sing thee songs. In this hall of thine I have a corner seat.\nIn thy world I have no work to do; my useless life can only break out in tunes without a purpose.\nWhen the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of midnight, command me, my master, to stand before thee to sing.\nWhen in the morning air the golden harp is tuned, honour me, commanding my presence.\n16.\nI have had my invitation to this world's festival, and thus my life has been blessed. My eyes have seen and my ears have heard.\nIt was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument, and I have done all I could.\nNow, I ask, has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face and offer thee my silent salutation?\n17.\nI am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands. That is why it is so late and why I have been guilty of such omissions.\nThey come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast; but I evade them ever, for I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.\nPeople blame me and call me heedless; I doubt not they are right in their blame.\nThe market day is over and work is all done for the busy. Those who came to call me in vain have gone back in anger. I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.\n18.\nClouds heap upon clouds and it darkens. Ah, love, why dost thou let me wait outside at the door all alone?\nIn the busy moments of the noontide work I am with the crowd, but on this dark lonely day it is only for thee that I hope.\nIf thou showest me not thy face, if thou leavest me wholly aside, I know not how I am to pass these long, rainy hours.\nI keep gazing on the far-away gloom of the sky, and my heart wanders wailing with the restless wind.\n19.\nIf thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience.\nThe morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.\nThen thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.\n20.\nOn the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.\nOnly now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.\nThat vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.\nI knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.\n21.\nI must launch out my boat. The languid hours pass by on the shore - Alas for me!\nThe spring has done its flowering and taken leave. And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger.\nThe waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane the yellow leaves flutter and fall.\nWhat emptiness do you gaze upon! Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air with the notes of the far-away song floating from the other shore?\n22.\nIn the deep shadows of the rainy July, with secret steps, thou walkest, silent as night, eluding all watchers.\nToday the morning has closed its eyes, heedless of the insistent calls of the loud east wind, and a thick veil has been drawn over the ever-wakeful blue sky.\nThe woodlands have hushed their songs, and doors are all shut at every house. Thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street. Oh my only friend, my best beloved, the gates are open in my house - do not pass by like a dream.\n23.\nArt thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love, my friend? The sky groans like one in despair.\nI have no sleep tonight. Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend!\nI can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path!\nBy what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend?\n24.\nIf the day is done, if birds sing no more, if the wind has flagged tired, then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.\nFrom the traveller, whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended, whose garment is torn and dustladen, whose strength is exhausted, remove shame and poverty, and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night.\n25.\nIn the night of weariness let me give myself up to sleep without struggle, resting my trust upon thee.\nLet me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship.\nIt is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening.\n26.\nHe came and sat by my side but I woke not. What a cursed sleep it was, O miserable me!\nHe came when the night was still; he had his harp in his hands, and my dreams became resonant with its melodies.\nAlas, why are my nights all thus lost? Ah, why do I ever miss his sight whose breath touches my sleep?\n27.\nLight, oh where is the light? Kindle it with the burning fire of desire!\nThere is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame - is such thy fate, my heart? Ah, death were better by far for thee!\nMisery knocks at thy door, and her message is that thy lord is wakeful, and he calls thee to the love-tryst through the darkness of night.\nThe sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless. I know not what this is that stirs in me - I know not its meaning.\nA moment's flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight, and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me.\nLight, oh where is the light! Kindle it with the burning fire of desire! It thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void. The night is black as a black stone. Let not the hours pass by in the dark. Kindle the lamp of love with thy life.\n28.\nObstinate are the trammels, but my heart aches when I try to break them.\nFreedom is all I want, but to hope for it I feel ashamed.\nI am certain that priceless wealth is in thee, and that thou art my best friend, but I have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that fills my room.\nThe shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death; I hate it, yet hug it in love.\nMy debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet when I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted.\n29.\nHe whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon. I am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow.\nI take pride in this great wall, and I plaster it with dust and sand lest a least hole should be left in this name; and for all the care I take I lose sight of my true being.\n30.\nI move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not.\nHe makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter.\nHe is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company.\n31.\n'Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?'\n'It was my master,' said the prisoner. 'I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, and I amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bad that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.'\n'Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?'\n'It was I,' said the prisoner, 'who forged this chain very carefully. I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. When at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip.'\n32.\nBy all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs, and thou keepest me free.\nLest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. But day passes by after day and thou art not seen.\nIf I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart, thy love for me still waits for my love.\n33.\nWhen it was day they came into my house and said, 'We shall only take the smallest room here.'\nBut in the darkness of night I find they break into my sacred shrine, strong and turbulent, and snatch with unholy greed the offerings from God's altar.\n34.\nLet only that little be left of me whereby I may name thee my all.\nLet only that little be left of my will whereby I may feel thee on every side, and come to thee in everything, and offer to thee my love every moment.\nLet only that little be left of me whereby I may never hide thee.\nLet only that little of my fetters be left whereby I am bound with thy will, and thy purpose is carried out in my life - and that is the fetter of thy love.\n35.\nWhere the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action- Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\n36.\nThis is my prayer to thee, my lord - strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart. Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows. Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service. Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might. Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles. And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.\n37.\nI thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power, - that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.\nBut I find that thy will knows no end in me. And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders.\n38.\nThat I want thee, only thee - let my heart repeat without end. All desires that distract me, day and night, are false and empty to the core.\nAs the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry - 'I want thee, only thee'.\nAs the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is - 'I want thee, only thee'.\n39.\nWhen the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of mercy.\nWhen grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song.\nWhen tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest.\nWhen my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.\nWhen desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder.\n40.\nThe rain has held back for days and days, my God, in my arid heart. The horizon is fiercely naked - not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud, not the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower.\nSend thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end.\nBut call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.\nLet the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the father's wrath.\n41.\nWhere dost thou stand behind them all, my lover, hiding thyself in the shadows? They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road, taking thee for naught. I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee, while passers-by come and take my flowers, one by one, and my basket is nearly empty.\nThe morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not.\nOh, how, indeed, could I tell them that for thee I wait, and that thou hast promised to come. How could I utter for shame that I keep for my dowry this poverty. Ah, I hug this pride in the secret of my heart.\nI sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming - all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying over thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a creeper in a summer breeze.\nBut time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot. Many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory. Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all? And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing?\n42.\nEarly in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.\nIn that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words.\nIs the time not come yet? Are there works still to do? Lo, the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests.\nWho knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?\n43.\nThe day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life.\nAnd today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.\nThou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and the steps that I heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star.\n44.\nThis is my delight, thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow chases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer.\nMessengers, with tidings from unknown skies, greet me and speed along the road. My heart is glad within, and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet.\nFrom dawn till dusk I sit here before my door, and I know that of a sudden the happy moment will arrive when I shall see.\nIn the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone. In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise.\n45.\nHave you not heard his silent steps? He comes, comes, ever comes.\nEvery moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes.\nMany a song have I sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes have always proclaimed, 'He comes, comes, ever comes.'\nIn the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes.\nIn the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes.\nIn sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n46.\nI know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet me. Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye.\nIn many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret.\nI know not only why today my life is all astir, and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart.\nIt is as if the time were come to wind up my work, and I feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence.\n47.\nThe night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain. I fear lest in the morning he suddenly come to my door when I have fallen asleep wearied out. Oh friends, leave the way open to him - forbid him not.\nIf the sounds of his steps does not wake me, do not try to rouse me, I pray. I wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of birds, by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light. Let me sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door.\nAh, my sleep, precious sleep, which only waits for his touch to vanish. Ah, my closed eyes that would open their lids only to the light of his smile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of sleep.\nLet him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all forms. The first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his glance. And let my return to myself be immediate return to him.\n48.\nThe morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed.\nWe sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We quickened our pave more and more as the time sped by.\nThe sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and I laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass.\nMy companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze. They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries. All honour to you, heroic host of the interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation - in the shadow of a dim delight.\nThe repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart. I forgot for what I had travelled, and I surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs.\nAt last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was hard!\n49.\nYou came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door.\nI was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear. You came down and stood at my cottage door.\nMasters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours. But the simple carol of this novice struck at your love. One plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door.\n50.\nI had gone a-begging from door to door in the village path, when thy golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and I wondered who was this King of all kings!\nMy hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end, and I stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on all sides in the dust.\nThe chariot stopped where I stood. Thy glance fell on me and thou camest down with a smile. I felt that the luck of my life had come at last. Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say 'What hast thou to give to me?'\nAh, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg! I was confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet I slowly took out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee.\nBut how great my surprise when at the day's end I emptied my bag on the floor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap. I bitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee my all.\n51.\nThe night darkened. Our day's works had been done. We thought that the last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut. Only some said the king was to come. We laughed and said 'No, it cannot be!'\nIt seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind. We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep. Only some said, 'It is the messenger!' We laughed and said 'No, it must be the wind!'\nThere came a sound in the dead of the night. We sleepily thought it was the distant thunder. The earth shook, the walls rocked, and it troubled us in our sleep. Only some said it was the sound of wheels. We said in a drowsy murmur, 'No, it must be the rumbling of clouds!'\nThe night was still dark when the drum sounded. The voice came 'Wake up! delay not!' We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear. Some said, 'Lo, there is the king's flag!' We stood up on our feet and cried 'There is no time for delay!'\nThe king has come - but where are lights, where are wreaths? Where is the throne to seat him? Oh, shame! Oh utter shame! Where is the hall, the decorations? Someone has said, 'Vain is this cry! Greet him with empty hands, lead him into thy rooms all bare!'\nOpen the doors, let the conch-shells be sounded! in the depth of the night has come the king of our dark, dreary house. The thunder roars in the sky. The darkness shudders with lightning. Bring out thy tattered piece of mat and spread it in the courtyard. With the storm has come of a sudden our king of the fearful night.\n52.\nI thought I should ask of thee - but I dared not - the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck. Thus I waited for the morning, when thou didst depart, to find a few fragments on the bed. And like a beggar I searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two.\nAh me, what is it I find? What token left of thy love? It is no flower, no spices, no vase of perfumed water. It is thy mighty sword, flashing as a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder. The young light of morning comes through the window and spread itself upon thy bed. The morning bird twitters and asks, 'Woman, what hast thou got?' No, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water - it is thy dreadful sword.\nI sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine. I can find no place to hide it. I am ashamed to wear it, frail as I am, and it hurts me when press it to my bosom. Yet shall I bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine.\nFrom now there shall be no fear left for me in this world, and thou shalt be victorious in all my strife. Thou hast left death for my companion and I shall crown him with my life. Thy sword is with me to cut asunder my bonds, and there shall be no fear left for me in the world.\nFrom now I leave off all petty decorations. Lord of my heart, no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour. Thou hast given me thy sword for adornment. No more doll's decorations for me!\n53.\nBeautiful is thy wristlet, decked with stars and cunningly wrought in myriad-coloured jewels. But more beautiful to me thy sword with its curve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of Vishnu, perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset.\nIt quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the final stroke of death; it shines like the pure flame of being burning up earty sense with one fierce flash.\nBeautiful is thy wristlet, decked with starry gems; but thy sword, O lord of thunder, is wrought with uttermost beauty, terrible to behold or think of.\n54.\nI asked nothing from thee; I uttered not my name to thine ear. When thou took'st thy leave I stood silent. I was alone by the well where the shadow of the tree fell aslant, and the women had gone home with their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim. They called me and shouted, 'Come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon.' But I languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings.\nI heard not thy steps as thou camest. Thine eyes were sad when they fell on me; thy voice was tired as thou spokest low - 'Ah, I am a thirsty traveller.' I started up from my day-dreams and poured water from my jar on thy joined palms. The leaves rustled overhead; the cuckoo sang from the unseen dark, and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend of the road.\nI stood speecess with shame when my name thou didst ask. Indeed, what had I done for thee to keep me in remembrance? But the memory that I could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and enfold it in sweetness. The morning hour is late, the bird sings in weary notes, neem leaves rustle overhead and I sit and think and think.\n55.\nLanguor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes.\nHas not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour among thorns? Wake, oh awaken! let not the time pass in vain!\nAt the end of the stony path, in the country of virgin solitude, my friend is sitting all alone. Deceive him not. Wake, oh awaken!\nWhat if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun - what if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst -\nIs there no joy in the deep of your heart? At every footfall of yours, will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain?\n56.\nThus it is that thy joy in me is so full. Thus it is that thou hast come down to me. O thou lord of all heavens, where would be thy love if I were not?\nThou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth. In my heart is the endless play of thy delight. In my life thy will is ever taking shape.\nAnd for this, thou who art the King of kings hast decked thyself in beauty to captivate my heart. And for this thy love loses itself in the love of thy lover, and there art thou seen in the perfect union of two.\n57.\nLight, my light, the world-filling light, the eye-kissing light, heart-sweetening light!\nAh, the light dances, my darling, at the centre of my life; the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth.\nThe butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light.\nThe light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion.\nMirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure. The heaven's river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad.\n58.\nLet all the strains of joy mingle in my last song - the joy that makes the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass, the joy that sets the twin brothers, life and death, dancing over the wide world, the joy that sweeps in with the tempest, shaking and waking all life with laughter, the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red lotus of pain, and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust, and knows not a word.\n59.\nYes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, O beloved of my heart - this golden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing across the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead.\nThe morning light has flooded my eyes - this is thy message to my heart. Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet.\n60.\nOn the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.\nThey build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.\nThey know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. they seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.\nThe sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach.\nOn the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the patess sky, ships get wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.\n61.\nThe sleep that flits on baby's eyes - does anybody know from where it comes? Yes, there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where, in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glow-worms, there hang two timid buds of enchantment. From there it comes to kiss baby's eyes.\nThe smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps - does anybody know where it was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning - the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps.\nThe sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby's limbs - does anybody know where it was hidden so long? Yes, when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love - the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on baby's limbs.\n62.\nWhen I bring to you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted in tints - when I give coloured toys to you, my child.\nWhen I sing to make you dance I truly now why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth - when I sing to make you dance.\nWhen I bring sweet things to your greedy hands I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice - when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands.\nWhen I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body - when I kiss you to make you smile.\n63.\nThou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger.\nI am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forget that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest.\nThrough birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar.\nWhen one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of many.\n64.\nOn the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her, 'Maiden, where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle? My house is all dark and lonesome - lend me your light!' she raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk. 'I have come to the river,' she said, 'to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west.' I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide.\nIn the silence of gathering night I asked her, 'Maiden, your lights are all lit - then where do you go with your lamp? My house is all dark and lonesome - lend me your light.' She raised her dark eyes on my face and stood for a moment doubtful. 'I have come,' she said at last, 'to dedicate my lamp to the sky.' I stood and watched her light uselessly burning in the void.\nIn the moonless gloom of midnight I ask her, 'Maiden, what is your quest, holding the lamp near your heart? My house is all dark and lonesome- - lend me your light.' She stopped for a minute and thought and gazed at my face in the dark. 'I have brought my light,' she said, 'to join the carnival of lamps.' I stood and watched her little lamp uselessly lost among lights.\n65.\nWhat divine drink wouldst thou have, my God, from this overflowing cup of my life?\nMy poet, is it thy delight to see thy creation through my eyes and to stand at the portals of my ears silently to listen to thine own eternal harmony?\nThy world is weaving words in my mind and thy joy is adding music to them. Thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own entire sweetness in me.\n66.\nShe who ever had remained in the depth of my being, in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; she who never opened her veils in the morning light, will be my last gift to thee, my God, folded in my final song.\nWords have wooed yet failed to win her; persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain.\nI have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life.\nOver my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart.\nmany a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair.\nThere was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition.\n67.\nThou art the sky and thou art the nest as well.\nO thou beautiful, there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours.\nThere comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth.\nAnd there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest.\nBut there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor colour, and never, never a word.\n68.\nThy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and stands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds made of my tears and sighs and songs.\nWith fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of misty cloud, turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring it with hues everchanging.\nIt is so light and so fleeting, tender and tearful and dark, that is why thou lovest it, O thou spotless and serene. And that is why it may cover thy awful white light with its pathetic shadows.\n69.\nThe same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.\nIt is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.\nIt is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow.\nI feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.\n70.\nIs it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm? to be tossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy?\nAll things rush on, they stop not, they look not behind, no power can hold them back, they rush on.\nKeeping steps with that restless, rapid music, seasons come dancing and pass away - colours, tunes, and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the abounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment.\n71.\nThat I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, thus casting coloured shadows on thy radiance - such is thy maya.\nThou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. This thy self-separation has taken body in me.\nThe poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloured tears and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, dreams break and form. In me is thy own defeat of self.\nThis screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures with the brush of the night and the day. Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, casting away all barren lines of straightness.\nThe great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.\n72.\nHe it is, the innermost one, who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches.\nHe it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart in varied cadence of pleasure and pain.\nHe it is who weaves the web of this maya in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green, and lets peep out through the folds his feet, at whose touch I forget myself.\nDays come and ages pass, and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name, in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow.\n73.\nDeliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.\nThou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim.\nMy world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple.\nNo, I will never shut the doors of my senses. The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight.\nYes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love.\n74.\nThe day is no more, the shadow is upon the earth. It is time that I go to the stream to fill my pitcher.\nThe evening air is eager with the sad music of the water. Ah, it calls me out into the dusk. In the lonely lane there is no passer-by, the wind is up, the ripples are rampant in the river.\nI know not if I shall come back home. I know not whom I shall chance to meet. There at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays upon his lute.\n75.\nThy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to thee undiminished.\nThe river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and hamlets; yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of thy feet.\nThe flower sweetens the air with its perfume; yet its last service is to offer itself to thee.\nThy worship does not impoverish the world.\nFrom the words of the poet men take what meanings please them; yet their last meaning points to thee.\n76.\nDay after day, O lord of my life, shall I stand before thee face to face. With folded hands, O lord of all worlds, shall I stand before thee face to face.\nUnder thy great sky in solitude and silence, with humble heart shall I stand before thee face to face.\nIn this laborious world of thine, tumultuous with toil and with struggle, among hurrying crowds shall I stand before thee face to face.\nAnd when my work shall be done in this world, O King of kings, alone and speecess shall I stand before thee face to face.\n77.\nI know thee as my God and stand apart - I do not know thee as my own and come closer. I know thee as my father and bow before thy feet- I do not grasp thy hand as my friend's.\nI stand not where thou comest down and ownest thyself as mine, there to clasp thee to my heart and take thee as my comrade.\nThou art the Brother amongst my brothers, but I heed them not, I divide not my earnings with them, thus sharing my all with thee.\nIn pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men, and thus stand by thee. I shrink to give up my life, and thus do not plunge into the great waters of life.\n78.\nWhen the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first splendour, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang 'Oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!'\nBut one cried of a sudden - 'It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light and one of the stars has been lost.'\nThe golden string of their harp snapped, their song stopped, and they cried in dismay - 'Yes, that lost star was the best, she was the glory of all heavens!'\nFrom that day the search is unceasing for her, and the cry goes on from one to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy!\nOnly in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among themselves - 'Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'\n79.\nIf it is not my portion to meet thee in this life then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight - let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\nAs my days pass in the crowded market of this world and my hands grow full with the daily profits, let me ever feel that I have gained nothing - let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\nWhen I sit by the roadside, tired and panting, when I spread my bed low in the dust, let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me - let me not forget a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\nWhen my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound and the laughter there is loud, let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house - let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\n80.\nI am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky, O my sun ever-glorious! Thy touch has not yet melted my vapour, making me one with thy light, and thus I count months and years separated from thee.\nIf this be thy wish and if this be thy play, then take this fleeting emptiness of mine, paint it with colours, gild it with gold, float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders.\nAnd again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, I shall melt and vanish away in the dark, or it may be in a smile of the white morning, in a coolness of purity transparent.\n81.\nOn many an idle day have I grieved over lost time. But it is never lost, my lord. Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands.\nHidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness.\nI was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased. In the morning I woke up and found my garden full with wonders of flowers.\n82.\nTime is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy minutes.\nDays and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait.\nWe have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chances. We are too poor to be late.\nAnd thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.\nAt the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut; but I find that yet there is time.\n83.\nMother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow.\nThe stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but mine will hang upon thy breast.\nWealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace.\n84.\nIt is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and gives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky.\nIt is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness of July.\nIt is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires, into sufferings and joy in human homes; and this it is that ever melts and flows in songs through my poet's heart.\n85.\nWhen the warriors came out first from their master's hall, where had they hid their power? Where were their armour and their arms?\nWhen the warriors marched back again to their master's hall where did they hide their power?\nThey had dropped the sword and dropped the bow and the arrow; peace was on their foreheads, and they had left the fruits of their life behind them on the day they marched back again to their master's hall.\n86.\nDeath, thy servant, is at my door. He has crossed the unknown sea and brought thy call to my home.\nThe night is dark and my heart is fearful - yet I will take up the lamp, open my gates and bow to him my welcome. It is thy messenger who stands at my door.\nI will worship him placing at his feet the treasure of my heart.\nHe will go back with his errand done, leaving a dark shadow on my morning; and in my desolate home only my forlorn self will remain as my last offering to thee.\n87.\nIn desperate hope I go and search for her in all the corners of my room; I find her not.\nMy house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained.\nBut infinite is thy mansion, my lord, and seeking her I have to come to thy door.\nI stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky and I lift my eager eyes to thy face.\nI have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish - no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears.\nOh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, plunge it into the deepest fullness. Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of the universe.\n88.\nDeity of the ruined temple! The broken strings of Vina sing no more your praise. The bells in the evening proclaim not your time of worship. The air is still and silent about you.\nIn your desolate dwelling comes the vagrant spring breeze. It brings the tidings of flowers - the flowers that for your worship are offered no more.\nYour worshipper of old wanders ever longing for favour still refused. In the eventide, when fires and shadows mingle with the gloom of dust, he wearily comes back to the ruined temple with hunger in his heart.\nMany a festival day comes to you in silence, deity of the ruined temple. Many a night of worship goes away with lamp unlit.\nMany new images are built by masters of cunning art and carried to the holy stream of oblivion when their time is come.\nOnly the deity of the ruined temple remains unworshipped in deatess neglect.\n89.\nNo more noisy, loud words from me - such is my master's will. Henceforth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.\nMen hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.\nLet then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.\nFull many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!\n90.\nOn the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to him?\nOh, I will set before my guest the full vessel of my life - I will never let him go with empty hands.\nAll the sweet vintage of all my autumn days and summer nights, all the earnings and gleanings of my busy life will I place before him at the close of my days when death will knock at my door.\n91.\nO thou the last fulfilment of life, Death, my death, come and whisper to me!\nDay after day I have kept watch for thee; for thee have I borne the joys and pangs of life.\nAll that I am, that I have, that I hope and all my love have ever flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy. One final glance from thine eyes and my life will be ever thine own.\nThe flowers have been woven and the garland is ready for the bridegroom. After the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night.\n92.\nI know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be lost, and life will take its leave in silence, drawing the last curtain over my eyes.\nYet stars will watch at night, and morning rise as before, and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.\nWhen I think of this end of my moments, the barrier of the moments breaks and I see by the light of death thy world with its careless treasures. Rare is its lowliest seat, rare is its meanest of lives.\nThings that I longed for in vain and things that I got - let them pass. Let me but truly possess the things that I ever spurned and overlooked.\n93.\nI have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! I bow to you all and take my departure.\nHere I give back the keys of my door - and I give up all claims to my house. I only ask for last kind words from you.\nWe were neighbours for long, but I received more than I could give. Now the day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. A summons has come and I am ready for my journey.\n94.\nAt this time of my parting, wish me good luck, my friends! The sky is flushed with the dawn and my path lies beautiful.\nAsk not what I have with me to take there. I start on my journey with empty hands and expectant heart.\nI shall put on my wedding garland. Mine is not the red-brown dress of the traveller, and though there are dangers on the way I have no fear in mind.\nThe evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive notes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the King's gateway.\n95.\nI was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life.\nWhat was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight!\nWhen in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother.\nEven so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well.\nThe child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away, in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation.\n96.\nWhen I go from hence let this be my parting word, that what I have seen is unsurpassable.\nI have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus am I blessed - let this be my parting word.\nIn this playhouse of infinite forms I have had my play and here have I caught sight of him that is formless.\nMy whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch; and if the end comes here, let it come - let this be my parting word.\n97.\nWhen my play was with thee I never questioned who thou wert. I knew nor shyness nor fear, my life was boisterous.\nIn the early morning thou wouldst call me from my sleep like my own comrade and lead me running from glade to glade.\nOn those days I never cared to know the meaning of songs thou sangest to me. Only my voice took up the tunes, and my heart danced in their cadence.\nNow, when the playtime is over, what is this sudden sight that is come upon me? The world with eyes bent upon thy feet stands in awe with all its silent stars.\n98.\nI will deck thee with trophies, garlands of my defeat. It is never in my power to escape unconquered.\nI surely know my pride will go to the wall, my life will burst its bonds in exceeding pain, and my empty heart will sob out in music like a hollow reed, and the stone will melt in tears.\nI surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared.\nFrom the blue sky an eye shall gaze upon me and summon me in silence. Nothing will be left for me, nothing whatever, and utter death shall I receive at thy feet.\n99.\nWhen I give up the helm I know that the time has come for thee to take it. What there is to do will be instantly done. Vain is this struggle.\nThen take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you are placed.\nThese my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying to light them I forget all else again and again.\nBut I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on the floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and take thy seat here.\n100.\nI dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms, hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless.\nNo more sailing from harbour to harbour with this my weather-beaten boat. The days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves.\nAnd now I am eager to die into the deatess.\nInto the audience hall by the fathomless abyss where swells up the music of toneless strings I shall take this harp of my life.\nI shall tune it to the notes of forever, and when it has sobbed out its last utterance, lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent.\n101.\nEver in my life have I sought thee with my songs. It was they who led me from door to door, and with them have I felt about me, searching and touching my world.\nIt was my songs that taught me all the lessons I ever learnt; they showed me secret paths, they brought before my sight many a star on the horizon of my heart.\nThey guided me all the day long to the mysteries of the country of pleasure and pain, and, at last, to what palace gate have the brought me in the evening at the end of my journey?\n102.\nI boasted among men that I had known you. They see your pictures in all works of mine. They come and ask me, 'Who is he?' I know not how to answer them. I say, 'Indeed, I cannot tell.' They blame me and they go away in scorn. And you sit there smiling.\nI put my tales of you into lasting songs. The secret gushes out from my heart. They come and ask me, 'Tell me all your meanings.' I know not how to answer them. I say, 'Ah, who knows what they mean!' They smile and go away in utter scorn.

{"title": "A Poet's Death Is His Life IV", "author": "Khalil Gibran", "text": "The dark wings of night enfolded the city upon which Nature had spread a pure white garment of snow; and men deserted the streets for their houses in search of warmth, while the north wind probed in contemplation of laying waste the gardens. There in the suburb stood an old hut heavily laden with snow and on the verge of falling. In a dark recess of that hovel was a poor bed in which a dying youth was lying, staring at the dim light of his oil lamp, made to flicker by the entering winds. He a man in the spring of life who foresaw fully that the peaceful hour of freeing himself from the clutches of life was fast nearing. He was awaiting Death's visit gratefully, and upon his pale face appeared the dawn of hope; and on his lops a sorrowful smile; and in his eyes forgiveness.\nHe was poet perishing from hunger in the city of living rich. He was placed in the earthly world to enliven the heart of man with his beautiful and profound sayings. He as noble soul, sent by the Goddess of Understanding to soothe and make gentle the human spirit. But alas! He gladly bade the cold earth farewell without receiving a smile from its strange occupants.\nHe was breathing his last and had no one at his bedside save the oil lamp, his only companion, and some parchments upon which he had inscribed his heart's feeling. As he salvaged the remnants of his withering strength he lifted his hands heavenward; he moved his eyes hopelessly, as if wanting to penetrate the ceiling in order to see the stars from behind the veil clouds.\nAnd he said, \"Come, oh beautiful Death; my soul is longing for you. Come close to me and unfasten the irons life, for I am weary of dragging them. Come, oh sweet Death, and deliver me from my neighbors who looked upon me as a stranger because I interpret to them the language of the angels. Hurry, oh peaceful Death, and carry me from these multitudes who left me in the dark corner of oblivion because I do not bleed the weak as they do. Come, oh gentle Death, and enfold me under your white wings, for my fellowmen are not in want of me. Embrace me, oh Death, full of love and mercy; let your lips touch my lips which never tasted a mother's kiss, not touched a sister's cheeks, not caresses a sweetheart's fingertips. Come and take me, by beloved Death.\"\nThen, at the bedside of the dying poet appeared an angel who possessed a supernatural and divine beauty, holding in her hand a wreath of lilies. She embraced him and closed his eyes so he could see no more, except with the eye of his spirit. She impressed a deep and long and gently withdrawn kiss that left and eternal smile of fulfillment upon his lips. Then the hovel became empty and nothing was lest save parchments and papers which the poet had strewn with bitter futility.\nHundreds of years later, when the people of the city arose from the diseases slumber of ignorance and saw the dawn of knowledge, they erected a monument in the most beautiful garden of the city and celebrated a feast every year in honor of that poet, whose writings had freed them.

For I am a poet, and if I cannot give, I shall refuse to receive.\nHumanity rages like a tempest, but I sigh in silence for I know the storm must pass away while a sigh goes to God.\nHuman kinds cling to earthly things, but I seek ever to embrace the torch of love so it will purify me by its fire and sear inhumanity from my heart.\nSubstantial things deaden a man without suffering; love awakens him with enlivening pains.\nHumans are divided into different clans and tribes, and belong to countries and towns. But I find myself a stranger to all communities and belong to no settlement. The universe is my country and the human family is my tribe.\nMen are weak, and it is sad that they divide amongst themselves. The world is narrow and it is unwise to cleave it into kingdoms, empires, and provinces.\nHuman kinds unite themselves one to destroy the temples of the soul, and they join hands to build edifices for earthly bodies. I stand alone listening to the voice of hope in my deep self saying, \"As love enlivens a man's heart with pain, so ignorance teaches him the way of knowledge.\" Pain and ignorance lead to great joy and knowledge because the Supreme Being has created nothing vain under the sun.\nPart Two\nI have a yearning for my beautiful country, and I love its people because of their misery. But if my people rose, stimulated by plunder and motivated by what they call \"patriotic spirit\" to murder, and invaded my neighbor's country, then upon the committing of any human atrocity I would hate my people and my country.\nI sing the praise of my birthplace and long to see the home of my children; but if the people in that home refused to shelter and feed the needy wayfarer, I would convert my praise into anger and my longing to forgetfulness. My inner voice would say, \"The house that does not comfort the need is worthy of naught by destruction.\"\nI love my native village with some of my love for my country; and I love my country with part of my love for the earth, all of which is my country; and I love the earth will all of myself because it is the haven of humanity, the manifest spirit of God.\nHumanity is the spirit of the Supreme Being on earth, and that humanity is standing amidst ruins, hiding its nakedness behind tattered rags, shedding tears upon hollow cheeks, and calling for its children with pitiful voice. But the children are busy singing their clan's anthem; they are busy sharpening the swords and cannot hear the cry of their mothers.\nHumanity appeals to its people but they listen not. Were one to listen, and console a mother by wiping her tears, other would say, \"He is weak, affected by sentiment.\"\nPart Three\nThou art my brother because you are a human, and we both are sons of one Holy Spirit; we are equal and made of the same earth.\nYou are here as my companion along the path of life, and my aid in understanding the meaning of hidden Truth. You are a human, and, that fact sufficing, I love you as a brother. You may speak of me as you choose, for Tomorrow shall take you away and will use your talk as evidence for his judgment, and you shall receive justice.\nYou may deprive me of whatever I possess, for my greed instigated the amassing of wealth and you are entitled to my lot if it will satisfy you.\nYou may do unto me whatever you wish, but you shall not be able to touch my Truth.\nYou may shed my blood and burn my body, but you cannot kill or hurt my spirit.\nYou may tie my hands with chains and my feet with shackles, and put me in the dark prison, but who shall not enslave my thinking, for it is free, like the breeze in the spacious sky.\nYou are my brother and I love you. I love you worshipping in your church, kneeling in your temple, and praying in your mosque. You and I and all are children of one religion, for the varied paths of religion are but the fingers of the loving hand of the Supreme Being, extended to all, offering completeness of spirit to all, anxious to receive all.\nI love you for your Truth, derived from your knowledge; that Truth which I cannot see because of my ignorance. But I respect it as a divine thing, for it is the deed of the spirit. Your Truth shall meet my Truth in the coming world and blend together like the fragrance of flowers and becoming one whole and eternal Truth, perpetuating and living in the eternity of Love and Beauty.\nI love you because you are weak before the strong oppressor, and poor before the greedy rich. For these reasons I shed tears and comfort you; and from behind my tears I see you embraced in the arms of Justice, smiling and forgiving your persecutors. You are my brother and I love you.\nPart Four\nYou are my brother, but why are you quarreling with me? Why do you invade my country and try to subjugate me for the sake of pleasing those who are seeking glory and authority?\nIs it an honor for a man to kill his brother man? If you deem it an honor, let it be an act of worship, and erect a temple to Cain who slew his brother Abel.\nIs self-preservation the first law of Nature? Why, then, does Greed urge you to self-sacrifice in order only to achieve his aim in hurting your brothers? Beware, my brother, of the leader who says, \"Love of existence obliges us to deprive the people of their rights!\" I say unto you but this: protecting others' rights is the noblest and most beautiful human act; if my existence requires that I kill others, then death is more honorable to me, and if I cannot find someone to kill me for the protection of my honor, I will not hesitate to take my life by my own hands for the sake of Eternity before Eternity comes.\nSelfishness, my brother, is the cause of blind superiority, and superiority creates clanship, and clanship creates authority which leads to discord and subjugation.\nThe only authority I obey is the knowledge of guarding and acquiescing in the Natural Law of Justice.\nWhat justice does authority display when it kills the killer? When it imprisons the robber? When it descends on a neighborhood country and slays its people? What does justice think of the authority under which a killer punishes the one who kills, and a thief sentences the one who steals?\nYou are my brother, and I love you; and Love is justice with its full intensity and dignity. If justice did not support my love for you, regardless of your tribe and community, I would be a deceiver concealing the ugliness of selfishness behind the outer garment of pure love.\nConclusion\nMy soul is my friend who consoles me in misery and distress of life. He who does not befriend his soul is an enemy of humanity, and he who does not find human guidance within himself will perish desperately. Life emerges from within, and derives not from environs.\nI came to say a word and I shall say it now. But if death prevents its uttering, it will be said tomorrow, for tomorrow never leaves a secret in the book of eternity.\nI came to live in the glory of love and the light of beauty, which are the reflections of God. \u00a0I am here living, and the people are unable to exile me from the domain of life for they know I will live in death. \u00a0If they pluck my eyes I will hearken to the murmers of love and the songs of beauty.\nIf they close my ears I will enjoy the touch of the breeze mixed with the incebse of love and the fragrance of beauty.\nIf they place me in a vacuum, I will live together with my soul, the child of love and beauty.\nI came here to be for all and with all, and what I do today in my solitude will be echoed by tomorrow to the people.\nWhat I say now with one heart will be said tomorrow by many hearts\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/A-Poet's-Voice-XV"}

She gazed upon me like a tender mother\nAnd wiped away my tears, and said : \"I have heard\nThe cry of your spirit and I am come to comfort it.\nOpen your heart to me and I shall fill it with light.\nAsk of me and I shall show you the way of truth.\"\nAnd I said : \"Who am I, Wisdom, and how came\nI to this frightening place? What manner of things\nAre these mighty hopes and these many books and\nStrange patterns ? What are these thoughts that pass\nAs doves in flight? And these words composed by\nDesire and sung by delight, what are they? What are\nThese conclusions, grievous and joyous, that embrace\nMy spirit and envelop my heart? And those\nEyes which look at me seeing into my depths and\nFleeing from my sorrows ? And those voices mourning\nMy days and chanting my littleness, what are they ?\n\"What is this youth that plays with my desires\nAnd mocks at my longings, forgetful of yesterday's\nDeeds, rejoicing in paltry things of the moment,\nScornful of the morrow's coming?\n\"What is this world that leads me whither I know\nNot, standing with me in despising? And this earth\nThat opens wide its mouth to swallow bodies and\nLets evil things to dwell on its breast? What is this\nCreature that is satisfied with the love of fortune,\nWhilst beyond its union is the pit? Who seeks Life's\nKiss whilst Death does smite him, and brings the\nPleasure of a minute with a year of repentance, and\nGives himself to slumber the while dreams call him?\nWhat is he who flows with the rivers of folly to the\nSea of darkness? O Wisdom, what manner of things\nAre these?\"\nAnd she answered, saying :\n\"You would see, human creature, this world\nThrough the eyes of a god. And you would seek to\nKnow the secrets of the hereafter with the thinking\nOf men. Yet in truth is this the height of folly.\n\"Go you to the wild places and you shall find\nThere the bee above the flowers and behold the eagle\nSwooping down on his prey. Go you into your neighbor's\nHouse and see then the child blinking at the\nFirelight and his mother busied at her household\nTasks. Be you like the bee and spend not the days of\nSpring looking on the eagle's doing. Be as the child\nAnd rejoice in the firelight and heed not your Mother's affairs. All that you see with your eyes was And is for your sake.\n\"The many books and the strange patterns and\nBeautiful thoughts are the shades of those spirits\nThat came ere you were come. The words that you\nDo weave are a bond between you and your brothers.\nThe conclusions, grievous and joyous, are the\nSeeds that the past did scatter in the field of the\nSpirit to be reaped by the future. That youth who\nPlays with your desires is he who will open the door\nOf your heart to let enter the light. This earth with\nThe ever open mouth is the savior of your spirit from\nThe body's slavery. This world which walks with\nYou is your heart; and your heart is all that you\nThink that world. This creature whom you see as\nIgnorant and small is the same who has come from\nGod's side to learn pity through sadness, and knowledge\nBy way of darkness.\"\nThen Wisdom put her hand on my burning brow\nAnd said:\n\"Go then forward and do not tarry, for beforeWwalks Perfection. Go, and have not fear of thorns\nOn the path, for they deem naught lawful save Corrupted blood.\"\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/A-Visit-From-Wisdom"}

{"title": "Before The Throne Of Beauty   XXVI", "author": "Khalil Gibran", "text": "One heavy day I ran away from the grim face of society and the dizzying clamor of the city and directed my weary step to the spacious alley. I pursued the beckoning course of the rivulet and the musical sounds of the birds until I reached a lonely spot where the flowing branches of the trees prevented the sun from the touching the earth.\nI stood there, and it was entertaining to my soul - my thirsty soul who had seen naught but the mirage of life instead of its sweetness.\nI was engrossed deeply in thought and my spirits were sailing the firmament when a hour, wearing a sprig of grapevine that covered part of her naked body, and a wreath of poppies about her golden hair, suddenly appeared to me. As she she realized my astonishment, she greeted me saying, \"Fear me not; I am the Nymph of the Jungle.\"\n\"How can beauty like yours be committed to live in this place? Please tell me who your are, and whence you come?\" I asked. She sat gracefully on the green grass and responded, \"I am the symbol of nature! I am the ever virgin your forefathers worshipped, and to my honor they erected shrines and temples at Baalbek and Jbeil.\" And I dared say, \"But those temples and shrines were laid waste and the bones of my adoring ancestors became a part of the earth; nothing was left to commemorate their goddess save a pitiful few and the forgotten pages in the book of history.\"\nShe replied, \"Some goddesses live in the lives of their worshippers and die in their deaths, while some live an eternal and infinite life. My life is sustained by the world of beauty which you will see where ever you rest your eyes, and this beauty is nature itself; it is the beginning of the shepherds joy among the hills, and a villagers happiness in the fields, and the pleasure of the awe filled tribes between the mountains and the plains. This Beauty promotes the wise into the throne the truth.\"\nThen I said, \"Beauty is a terrible power!\" And she retorted, \"Human beings fear all things, even yourselves. You fear heaven, the source of spiritual peace; you fear nature, the haven of rest and tranquility; you fear the God of goodness and accuse him of anger, while he is full of love and mercy.\"\nAfter a deep silence, mingled with sweet dreams, I asked, \"Speak to me of that beauty which the people interpret and define, each one according to his own conception; I have seen her honored and worshipped in different ways and manners.\"\nShe answered, \"Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive. When you meet Beauty, you feel that the hands deep within your inner self are stretched forth to bring her into the domain of your heart. It is the magnificence combined of sorrow and joy; it is the Unseen which you see, and the Vague which you understand, and the Mute which you hear - it is the Holy of Holies that begins in yourself and ends vastly beyond your earthly imagination.\"\nThen the Nymph of the Jungle approached me and laid her scented hands upon my eyes. And as she withdrew, I found me alone in the valley. When I returned to the city, whose turbulence no longer vexed me, I repeated her words:\n\"Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive.\"\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Before-The-Throne-Of-Beauty---XXVI"}

America faints! enrag'd the Zenith grew.\nAs human blood shooting its veins all round the orbed heaven\nRed rose the clouds from the Atlantic in vast wheels of blood\nAnd in the red clouds rose a Wonder o'er the Atlantic sea;\nIntense! naked! a Human fire fierce glowing, as the wedge\nOf iron heated in the furnace; his terrible limbs were fire\nWith myriads of cloudy terrors banners dark & towers\nSurrounded; heat but not light went thro' the murky atmosphere\nThe King of England looking westward trembles at the vision.\nAlbions Angel stood beside the Stone of night, and saw\nThe terror like a comet, or more like the planet red\nThat once inclos'd the terrible wandering comets in its sphere.\nThen Mars thou wast our center, & the planets three flew round\nThy crimson disk; so e'er the Sun was rent from thy red sphere;\nThe Spectre glowd his horrid length staining the temple long\nWith beams of blood; & thus a voice came forth, and shook the temple:\n\u201cThe morning comes, the night decays, the watchmen leave their stations;\nThe grave is burst, the spices shed, the linen wrapped up;\nThe bones of death, the cov'ring clay, the sinews shrunk & dry'd.\nReviving shake, inspiring move, breathing! awakening!\nSpring like redeemed captives when their bonds & bars are burst;\nLet the slave grinding at the mill, run out into the field:\nLet him look up into the heavens & laugh in the bright air;\nLet the inchained soul shut up in darkness and in sighing,\nWhose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years;\nRise and look out, his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open.\nAnd let his wife and children return from the opressors scourge;\n\u201cThey look behind at every step & believe it is a dream.\nSinging. The Sun has left his blackness, & has found a fresher morning\n\u2018And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear & cloudless night;\nFor Empire is no more, and now the Lion & Wolf shall cease.\u2019\u201d\nIn thunders ends the voice. Then Albions Angel wrathful burnt\nBeside the Stone of Night; and like the Eternal Lions howl\nIn famine & war, reply'd: \u201cArt thou not Orc, who serpent-form'd\nStands at the gate of Enitharmon to devour her children;\nBlasphemous Demon, Antichrist, hater of Dignities;\nLover of wild rebellion, and transgresser of Gods Law;\nWhy dost thou come to Angels eyes in this terrific form?\u201d\nThe terror answerd: \u201cI am Orc, wreath'd round the accursed tree:\nThe times are ended; shadows pass the morning gins to break;\nThe fiery joy, that Urizen perverted to ten commands,\nWhat night he led the starry hosts thro' the wide wilderness:\nThat stony law I stamp to dust: and scatter religion abroad\nTo the four winds as a torn book, & none shall gather the leaves;\nBut they shall rot on desart sands, & consume in bottomless deeps;\nTo make the desarts blossom, & the deeps shrink to their fountains,\nAnd to renew the fiery joy, and burst the stony roof.\nThat pale religious letchery, seeking Virginity,\nMay find it in a harlot, and in coarse-clad honesty\nThe undefil'd tho' ravish'd in her cradle night and morn:\nFor every thing that lives is holy, life delights in life;\nBecause the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd.\nFires inwrap the earthly globe, yet man is not consumd;\nAmidst the lustful fires he walks: his feet become like brass,\nHis knees and thighs like silver, & his breast and head like gold.\u201d\n\u201cSound! sound! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my Thirteen Angels!\nLoud howls the eternal Wolf! the eternal Lion lashes his tail!\nAmerica is darkned; and my punishing Demons terrified\nCrouch howling before their caverns deep like skins dry'd in the wind.\nThey cannot smite the wheat, nor quench the fatness of the earth.\nThey cannot smite with sorrows, nor subdue the plow and spade.\nThey cannot wall the city, nor moat round the castle of princes.\nThey cannot bring the stubbed oak to overgrow the hills.\nFor terrible men stand on the shores, & in their robes I see\nChildren take shelter from the lightnings, there stands Washington\nAnd Paine and Warren with their foreheads reard toward the east\nBut clouds obscure my aged sight. A vision from afar!\nSound! sound! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels:\nAh vision from afar! Ah rebel form that rent the ancient\nHeavens; Eternal Viper self-renew'd, rolling in clouds\nI see thee in thick clouds and darkness on America's shore.\nWrithing in pangs of abhorred birth; red flames the crest rebellious\nAnd eyes of death; the harlot womb oft opened in vain\nHeaves in enormous circles, now the times are return'd upon thee,\nDevourer of thy parent, now thy unutterable torment renews.\nSound! sound! my loud war trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels!\nAh terrible birth! a young one bursting! where is the weeping mouth?\nAnd where the mothers milk? instead those ever-hissing jaws\nAnd parched lips drop with fresh gore; now roll thou in the clouds\nThy mother lays her length outstretch'd upon the shore beneath.\nSound! sound! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels!\nLoud howls the eternal Wolf: the eternal Lion lashes his tail!\u201d\nThus wept the Angel voice & as he wept the terrible blasts\nOf trumpets, blew a loud alarm across the Atlantic deep.\nNo trumpets answer; no reply of clarions or of fifes,\nSilent the Colonies remain and refuse the loud alarm.\nOn those vast shady hills between America & Albions shore;\nNow barr'd out by the Atlantic sea: call'd Atlantean hills:\nBecause from their bright summits you may pass to the Golden world\nAn ancient palace, archetype of mighty Emperies,\nRears its immortal pinnacles, built in the forest of God\nBy Ariston the king of beauty for his stolen bride,\nHere on their magic seats the thirteen Angels sat perturb'd\nFor clouds from the Atlantic hover o'er the solemn roof.\nFiery the Angels rose, & as they rose deep thunder roll'd\nAround their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc\nAnd Bostons Angel cried aloud as they flew thro' the dark night.\nHe cried: \u201cWhy trembles honesty and like a murderer,\nWhy seeks he refuge from the frowns of his immortal station!\nMust the generous tremble & leave his joy, to the idle: to the pestilence!\nThat mock him? who commanded this? what God? what Angel!\nTo keep the gen'rous from experience till the ungenerous\nAre unrestraind performers of the energies of nature;\nTill pity is become a trade, and generosity a science,\nThat men get rich by, & the sandy desart is giv'n to the strong\nWhat pitying Angel lusts for tears, and fans himself with sighs\nWhat crawling villain preaches abstinence & wraps himself\nSo cried he, rending off his robe & throwing down his scepter.\nIn sight of Albions Guardian, and all the thirteen Angels\nRent off their robes to the hungry wind, & threw their golden scepters\nDown on the land of America. indignant they descended\nHeadlong from out their heav'nly heights, descending swift as fires\nOver the land; naked & flaming are their lineaments seen\nIn the deep gloom, by Washington & Paine & Warren they stood\nAnd the flame folded roaring fierce within the pitchy night\nBefore the Demon red, who burnt towards America,\nIn black smoke thunders and loud winds rejoicing in its terror\nBreaking in smoky wreaths from the wild deep, & gath'ring thick\nIn flames as of a furnace on the land from North to South\nWhat time the thirteen Governors that England sent convene\nIn Bernards house; the flames coverd the land, they rouze they cry\nShaking their mental chains they rush in fury to the sea\nTo quench their anguish; at the feet of Washington down fall'n\nThey grovel on the sand and writhing lie, while all\nThe British soldiers thro' the thirteen states sent up a howl\nOf anguish: threw their swords & muskets to the earth & ran\nFrom their encampments and dark castles seeking where to hide\nFrom the grim flames; and from the visions of Orc; in sight\nOf Albions Angel; who enrag'd his secret clouds open'd\nFrom north to south, and burnt outstretchd on wings of wrath cov'ring\nThe eastern sky, spreading his awful wings across the heavens;\nBeneath him roll'd his num'rous hosts, all Albions Angels camp'd\nDarkend the Atlantic mountains & their trumpets shook the valleys\nArm'd with diseases of the earth to cast upon the Abyss,\nTheir numbers forty millions, must'ring in the eastern sky.\nIn the flames stood & view'd the armies drawn out in the sky\nWashington Franklin Paine & Warren Allen Gates & Lee:\nAnd heard the voice of Albions Angel give the thunderous command:\nHis plagues obedient to his voice flew forth out of their clouds\nFalling upon America, as a storm to cut them off\nAs a blight cuts the tender corn when it begins to appear.\nDark is the heaven above, & cold & hard the earth beneath;\nAnd as a plague wind fill'd with insects cuts off man & beast;\nAnd as a sea o'erwhelms a land in the day of an earthquake,\nFury! rage! madness! in a wind swept through America\nAnd the red flames of Orc that folded roaring fierce around\nThe angry shores, and the fierce rushing of th'inhabitants together:\nThe citizens of New-York close their books & lock their chests;\nThe mariners of Boston drop their anchors and unlade;\nThe scribe of Pensylvania casts his pen upon the earth;\nThe builder of Virginia throws his hammer down in fear.\nThen had America been lost, o'erwhelm'd by the Atlantic,\nAnd Earth had lost another portion of the infinite,\nBut all rush together in the night in wrath and raging fire\nThe red fires rag'd! the plagues recoil'd! then rolld they back with fury\nOn Albions Angels; then the Pestilence began in streaks of red\nAcross the limbs of Albions Guardian, the spotted plague smote Bristols\nAnd the Leprosy Londons Spirit, sickening all their bands:\nThe millions sent up a howl of anguish and threw off their hammerd mail,\nAnd cast their swords & spears to earth, & stood a naked multitude.\nAlbions Guardian writhed in torment on the eastern sky\nPale quivring toward the brain his glimmering eyes, teeth chattering\nHowling & shuddering his legs quivering; convuls'd each muscle & sinew\nSick'ning lay Londons Guardian, and the ancient miter'd York\nTheir heads on snowy hills, their ensigns sick'ning in the sky\nThe plagues creep on the burning winds driven by flames of Orc,\nAnd by the fierce Americans rushing together in the night\nDriven o'er the Guardians of Ireland and Scotland and Wales\nThey spotted with plagues forsook the frontiers & their banners seard\nWith fires of hell, deform their ancient heavens with shame & woe.\nHid in his caves the Bard of Albion felt the enormous plagues.\nAnd a cowl of flesh grew o'er his head & scales on his back & ribs;\nAnd rough with black scales all his Angels fright their ancient heavens\nThe doors of marriage are open, and the Priests in rustling scales\nRush into reptile coverts, hiding from the fires of Orc,\nThat play around the golden roofsin wreaths of fierce desire,\nLeaving the females naked and glowing with the lusts of youth\nFor the female spirits of the dead pining in bonds of religion;\nRun from their fetters reddening, & in long drawn arches sitting:\nThey feel the nerves of youth renew, and desires of ancient times,\nOver their pale limbs as a vine when the tender grape appears\nOver the hills, the vales, the cities, rage the red flames fierce;\nThe Heavens melted from north to south; and Urizen who sat\nAbove all heavens in thunders wrap'd, emerg'd his leprous head\nFrom out his holy shrine, his tears in deluge piteous\nFalling into the deep sublime! flag'd with grey-brow'd snows\nAnd thunderous visages, his jealous wings wav'd over the deep;\nWeeping in dismal howling woe he dark descended howling\nAround the smitten bands, clothed in tears & trembling shudd'ring cold.\nHe open'd on the deep, and on the Atlantic sea white shiv'ring.\nLeprous his limbs, all over white, and hoary was his visage.\nWeeping in dismal howlings before the stern Americans\nHiding the Demon red with clouds & cold mists from the earth;\nTill Angels & weak men twelve years should govern o'er the strong:\nAnd then their end should come, when France reciev'd the Demons light.\nStiff shudderings shook the heav'nly thrones! France Spain & Italy,\nIn terror view'd the bands of Albion, and the ancient Guardians\nFainting upon the elements, smitten with their own plagues\nThey slow advance to shut the five gates of their law-built heaven\nFilled with blasting fancies and with mildews of despair\nWith fierce disease and lust, unable to stem the fires of Orc;\nBut the five gates were consum'd, & their bolts and hinges melted\nAnd the fierce flames burnt round the heavens, & round the abodes of men.\nFinis\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/15387909-America--A-Prophecy----2--A-Prophecy-by-William-Blake"}

down rushing\nOn the heads of Albions Angels.\nOne hour they lay buried beneath the ruins of that hall;\nBut as the stars rise from the salt lake they arise in pain,\nIn troubled mists o'erclouded by the terrors of strugling times.\nThe fiery King, who sought his ancient temple serpent-form'd\nThat stretches out its shady length along the Island white.\nRound him roll'd his clouds of war;

that which pitieth:\nTo a devouring flame; and man fled from its face and hid\nIn forests of night; then all the eternal forests were divided\nInto earths rolling in circles of space, that like an ocean rush'd\nAnd overwhelmed all except this finite wall of flesh.\nThen was the serpent temple form'd, image of infinite\nShut up in finite revolutions, and man became an Angel;\nHeaven a mighty circle turning; God a tyrant crown'd.\nNow arriv'd the ancient Guardian at the southern porch,\nThat planted thick with trees of blackest leaf, & in a vale\nObscure, inclos'd the Stone of Night; oblique it stood, o'erhung\nWith purple flowers and berries red;

compell'd\nInto the deadly night to see the form of Albions Angel\nTheir parents brought them forth & aged ignorance preaches canting,\nOn a vast rock, perciev'd by those senses that are clos'd from thought:\nBleak, dark, abrupt, it stands & overshadows London city\nThey saw his boney feet on the rock, the flesh consum'd in flames:\nThey saw the Serpent temple lifted above, shadowing the Island white:\nThey heard the voice of Albions Angel howling in flames of Orc,\nSeeking the trump of the last doom\nAbove the rest the howl was heard from Westminster louder & louder:\nThe Guardian of the secret codes forsook his ancient mansion,\nDriven out by the flames of Orc; his furr'd robes & false locks\nAdhered and grew one with his flesh, and nerves & veins shot thro' them\nWith dismal torment sick hanging upon the wind: he fled\nGroveling along Great George Street thro' the Park gate; all the soldiers\nFled from his sight; he drag'd his torments to the wilderness.\nThus was the howl thro Europe!\nFor Orc rejoic'd to hear the howling shadows\nBut Palamabron shot his lightnings trenching down his wide back\nAnd Rintrah hung with all his legions in the nether deep\nEnitharmon laugh'd in her sleep to see (O womans triumph)\nEvery house a den, every man bound; the shadows are filld\nWith spectres, and the windows wove over with curses of iron:\nOver the doors Thou shalt not; & over the chimneys Fear is written:\nWith bands of iron round their necks fasten'd into the walls\nThe citizens: in leaden gyves the inhabitants of suburbs\nWalk heavy: soft and bent are the bones of villagers\nBetween the clouds of Urizen the flames of Orc roll heavy\nAround the limbs of Albions Guardian, his flesh consuming.\nHowlings & hissings, shrieks & groans, & voices of despair\nArise around him in the cloudy\nHeavens of Albion, Furious\nThe red limb'd Angel siez'd, in horror and torment;\nThe Trump of the last doom;

But\nIn the Fourth region of Humanity, Urthona namd,\nMortality begins to roll the billows of Eternal Death\nBefore the Gate of Los. Urthona here is named Los.\nAnd here begins the System of Moral Virtue, named Rahab.\nAlbion fled thro' the Gate of Los, and he stood in the Gate.\nLos was the friend of Albion who most lov'd him. In Cambridgeshire\nHis eternal station, he is the twenty-eighth, & is four-fold.\nSeeing Albion had turn'd his back against the Divine Vision,\nLos said to Albion, Whither fleest thou? Albion reply'd.\nI die! I go to Eternal Death! the shades of death\nHover within me & beneath, and spreading themselves outside\nLike rocky clouds, build me a gloomy monument of woe:\nWill none accompany me in my death? or be a Ransom for me\nIn that dark Valley?

Man lives by deaths of Men\nBring him to justice before heaven here upon London stone,\nBetween Blackheath & Hounslow, between Norwood & Finchley\nAll that they have is mine: from my free genrous gift,\nThey now hold all they have: ingratitude to me!\nTo me their benefactor calls aloud for vengeance deep.\nLos stood before his Furnaces awaiting the fury of the Dead:\nAnd the Divine hand was upon him, strengthening him mightily.\nThe Spectres of the Dead cry out from the deeps beneath\nUpon the hills of Albion; Oxford groans in his iron furnace\nWinchester in his den & cavern; they lament against\nAlbion: they curse their human kindness & affection\nThey rage like wild beasts in the forests of affliction\nIn the dreams of Ulro they repent of their human kindness.\nCome up, build Babylon, Rahab is ours & all her multitudes\nWith her in pomp and glory of victory. Depart\nYe twenty-four into the deeps! let us depart to glory!\nTheir Human majestic forms sit up upon their Couches\nOf death: they curb their Spectres as with iron curbs\nThey enquire after Jerusalem in the regions of the dead,\nWith the voices of dead men, low, scarcely articulate,\nAnd with tears cold on their cheeks they weary repose.\nO when shall the morning of the grave appear, and when\nShall our salvation come? we sleep upon our watch\nWe cannot awake! and our Spectres rage in the forests\nO God of Albion where art thou! pity the watchers!\nThus mourn they. Loud the Furnaces of Los thunder upon\nThe clouds of Europe & Asia, among the Serpent Temples!\nAnd Los drew his Seven Furnaces around Albions Altars\nAnd as Albion built his frozen Altars, Los built the Mundane Shell,\nIn the Four Regions of Humanity East & West & North & South,\nTill Norwood & Finchley & Blackheath & Hounslow, coverd the whole Earth.\nThis is the Net & Veil of Vala, among the Souls of the Dead.\nPLATE 43\nThen the Divine Vision like a silent Sun appeard above\nAlbions dark rocks: setting behind the Gardens of Kensington\nOn Tyburns River, in clouds of blood: where was mild Zion Hills\nMost ancient promontory, and in the Sun, a Human Form appeard\nAnd thus the Voice Divine went forth upon the rocks of Albion\nI elected Albion for my glory; I gave to him the Nations,\nOf the whole Earth. he was the Angel of my Presence: and all\nThe Sons of God were Albions Sons: and Jerusalem was my joy.\nThe Reactor hath hid himself thro envy. I behold him.\nBut you cannot behold him till he be reveald in his System\nAlbions Reactor must have a Place prepard: Albion must Sleep\nThe Sleep of Death, till the Man of Sin & Repentance be reveald.\nHidden in Albions Forests he lurks: he admits of no Reply\nFrom Albion: but hath founded his Reaction into a Law\nOf Action, for Obedience to destroy the Contraries of Man.\nHe hath compelld Albion to become a Punisher & hath possessd\nHimself of Albions Forests & Wilds! and Jerusalem is taken!\nThe City of the Woods in the Forest of Ephratah is taken!\nLondon is a stone of her ruins; Oxford is the dust of her walls!\nSussex & Kent are her scatterd garments: Ireland her holy place!\nAnd the murderd bodies of her little ones are Scotland and Wales\nThe Cities of the Nations are the smoke of her consummation\nThe Nations are her dust! ground by the chariot wheels\nOf her lordly conquerors, her palaces levelld with the dust\nI come that I may find a way for my banished ones to return\nFear not O little Flock I come! Albion shall rise again.\nSo saying, the mild Sun inclosd the Human Family.\nForthwith from Albions darkning rocks came two Immortal forms\nSaying We alone are escaped. O merciful Lord and Saviour,\nWe flee from the interiors of Albions hills and mountains!\nFrom his Valleys Eastward: from Amalek Canaan & Moab:\nBeneath his vast ranges of hills surrounding Jerusalem.\nAlbion walkd on the steps of fire before his Halls\nAnd Vala walkd with him in dreams of soft deluding slumber.\nHe looked up & saw the Prince of Light with splendor faded\nThen Albion ascended mourning into the porches of his Palace\nAbove him rose a Shadow from his wearied intellect:\nOf living gold, pure, perfect, holy: in white linen pure he hoverd\nA sweet entrancing self-delusion a watry vision of Albion\nSoft exulting in existence; all the Man absorbing!\nAlbion fell upon his face prostrate before the watry Shadow\nSaying O Lord whence is this change! thou knowest I am nothing!\nAnd Vala trembled & coverd her face! & her locks were spread on the pavement\nWe heard astonishd at the Vision & our heart trembled within us:\nWe heard the voice of slumberous Albion, and thus he spake,\nIdolatrous to his own Shadow words of eternity uttering:\nO I am nothing when I enter into judgment with thee!\nIf thou withdraw thy breath I die & vanish into Hades\nIf thou dost lay thine hand upon me behold I am silent:\nIf thou withhold thine hand; I perish like a fallen leaf:\nO I am nothing: and to nothing must return again:\nIf thou withdraw thy breath. Behold I am oblivion.\nHe ceasd: the shadowy voice was silent: but the cloud hoverd over their heads\nIn golden wreathes, the sorrow of Man; & the balmy drops fell down.\nAnd lo! that son of Man that Shadowy Spirit of mild Albion:\nLuvah descended from the cloud; in terror Albion rose:\nIndignant rose the awful Man, & turnd his back on Vala.\nWe heard the voice of Albion starting from his sleep:\nWhence is this voice crying Enion! that soundeth in my ears?\nO cruel pity! O dark deceit! can love seek for dominion?\nAnd Luvah strove to gain dominion over Albion\nThey strove together above the Body where Vala was inclosd\nAnd the dark Body of Albion left prostrate upon the crystal pavement,\nCoverd with boils from head to foot: the terrible smitings of Luvah.\nThen frownd the fallen Man, and put forth Luvah from his presence\nSaying. Go and Die the Death of Man, for Vala the sweet wanderer.\nI will turn the volutions of your ears outward, and bend your nostrils\nDownward, and your fluxile eyes englob'd roll round in fear:\nYour withring lips and tongue shrink up into a narrow circle,\nTill into narrow forms you creep: go take your fiery way:\nAnd learn what tis to absorb the Man you Spirits of Pity & Love.\nThey heard the voice and fled swift as the winters setting sun.\nAnd now the human blood foamd high, the Spirits Luvah & Vala,\nWent down the Human Heart where Paradise & its joys abounded,\nIn jealous fears & fury & rage, & flames roll round their fervid feet:\nAnd the vast form of Nature like a serpent playd before them\nAnd as they fled in folding fires & thunders of the deep:\nVala shrunk in like the dark sea that leaves its slimy banks.\nAnd from her bosom Luvah fell far as the east and west.\nAnd the vast form of Nature like a serpent rolld between,\nWhether of Jerusalems or Valas ruins congenerated, we know not:\nAll is confusion: all is tumult, & we alone are escaped.\nSo spoke the fugitives; they joind the Divine Family, trembling\nPLATE 44\nAnd the Two that escaped; were the Emanation of Los & his\nSpectre: for whereever the Emanation goes, the Spectre\nAttends her as her Guard, & Los's Emanation is named\nEnitharmon, & his Spectre is named Urthona: they knew\nNot where to flee: they had been on a visit to Albions Children\nAnd they strove to weave a Shadow of the Emanation\nTo hide themselves: weeping & lamenting for the Vegetation\nOf Albions Children; fleeing thro Albions vales in streams of gore\nBeing not irritated by insult bearing insulting benevolences\nThey percieved that corporeal friends are spiritual enemies\nThey saw the Sexual Religion in its embryon Uncircumcision\nAnd the Divine hand was upon them bearing them thro darkness\nBack safe to their Humanity as doves to their windows:\nTherefore the Sons of Eden praise Urthonas Spectre in Songs\nBecause he kept the Divine Vision in time of trouble.\nThey wept & trembled: & Los put forth his hand & took them in\nInto his Bosom: from which Albion shrunk in dismal pain;\nRending the fibres of Brotherhood & in Feminine Allegories\nInclosing Los: but the Divine Vision appeard with Los\nAnd Los prayed and said. O Divine Saviour arise\nUpon the Mountains of Albion as in ancient time. Behold!\nThe Cities of Albion seek thy face, London groans in pain\nFrom Hill to Hill & the Thames laments along the Valleys\nThe little Villages of Middlesex & Surrey hunger & thirst\nThe Twenty-eight Cities of Albion stretch their hands to thee:\nBecause of the Opressors of Albion in every City & Village:\nThey mock at the Labourers limbs! they mock at his starvd Children.\nThey buy his Daughters that they may have power to sell his Sons:\nThey compell the Poor to live upon a crust of bread by soft mild arts:\nThey reduce the Man to want: then give with pomp & ceremony.\nThe praise of Jehovah is chaunted from lips of hunger & thirst!\nHumanity knows not of Sex: wherefore are Sexes in Beulah?\nIn Beulah the Female lets down her beautiful Tabernacle;\nWhich the Male enters magnificent between her Cherubim:\nAnd becomes One with her mingling condensing in Self-love\nThe Rocky Law of Condemnation & double Generation, & Death.\nAlbion hath enterd the Loins the place of the Last Judgment:\nAnd Luvah hath drawn the Curtains around Albion in Vala's bosom\nThe Dead awake to Generation! Arise O Lord, & rend the Veil!\nPLATE 45\nHis western heaven with rocky clouds of death & despair.\nFearing that Albion should turn his back against the Divine Vision\nLos took his globe of fire to search the interiors of Albions\nBosom, in all the terrors of friendship, entering the caves\nOf despair & death, to search the tempters out, walking among\nAlbions rocks & precipices! caves of solitude & dark despair,\nAnd saw every Minute Particular of Albion degraded & murderd\nBut saw not by whom; they were hidden within in the minute particulars\nOf which they had possessd themselves; and there they take up\nThe articulations of a mans soul, and laughing throw it down\nInto the frame, then knock it out upon the plank, & souls are bak'd\nIn bricks to build the pyramids of Heber & Terah. But Los\nSearchd in vain: closd from the minutia he walkd, difficult.\nHe came down from Highgate thro Hackney & Holloway towards London\nTill he came to old Stratford & thence to Stepney & the Isle\nOf Leuthas Dogs, thence thro the narrows of the Rivers side\nAnd saw every minute particular, the jewels of Albion, running down\nThe kennels of the streets & lanes as if they were abhorrd.\nEvery Universal Form, was become barren mountains of Moral\nVirtue: and every Minute Particular hardend into grains of sand:\nAnd all the tendernesses of the soul cast forth as filth & mire,\nAmong the winding places of deep contemplation intricate\nTo where the Tower of London frownd dreadful over Jerusalem:\nA building of Luvah builded in Jerusalems eastern gate to be\nHis secluded Court: thence to Bethlehem where was builded\nDens of despair in the house of bread: enquiring in vain\nOf stones and rocks he took his way, for human form was none:\nAnd thus he spoke, looking on Albions City with many tears\nWhat shall I do! what could I do, if I could find these Criminals\nI could not dare to take vengeance; for all things are so constructed\nAnd builded by the Divine hand, that the sinner shall always escape,\nAnd he who takes vengeance alone is the criminal of Providence;\nIf I should dare to lay my finger on a grain of sand\nIn way of vengeance; I punish the already punishd: O whom\nShould I pity if I pity not the sinner who is gone astray!\nO Albion, if thou takest vengeance; if thou revengest thy wrongs\nThou art for ever lost! What can I do to hinder the Sons\nOf Albion from taking vengeance? or how shall I them perswade.\nSo spoke Los, travelling thro darkness & horrid solitude:\nAnd he beheld Jerusalem in Westminster & Marybone,\nAmong the ruins of the Temple: and Vala who is her Shadow,\nJerusalems Shadow bent northward over the Island white.\nAt length he sat on London Stone, & heard Jerusalems voice.\nAlbion I cannot be thy Wife. thine own Minute Particulars,\nBelong to God alone. and all thy little ones are holy\nThey are of Faith & not of Demonstration: wherefore is Vala\nClothd in black mourning upon my rivers currents, Vala awake!\nI hear thy shuttles sing in the sky, and round my limbs\nI feel the iron threads of love & jealousy & despair.\nVala reply'd. Albion is mine! Luvah gave me to Albion\nAnd now recieves reproach & hate. Was it not said of old\nSet your Son before a man & he shall take you & your sons\nFor slaves: but set your Daughter before a man & She\nShall make him & his sons & daughters your slaves for ever!\nAnd is this Faith? Behold the strife of Albion, & Luvah\nIs great in the east, their spears of blood rage in the eastern heaven\nUrizen is the champion of Albion, they will slay my Luvah:\nAnd thou O harlot daughter! daughter of despair art all\nThis cause of these shakings of my towers on Euphrates.\nHere is the House of Albion, & here is thy secluded place\nAnd here we have found thy sins: & hence we turn thee forth,\nFor all to avoid thee: to be astonishd at thee for thy sins:\nBecause thou art the impurity & the harlot: & thy children!\nChildren of whoredoms: born for Sacrifice: for the meat & drink\nOffering: to sustain the glorious combat & the battle & war\nThat Man may be purified by the death of thy delusions.\nSo saying she her dark threads cast over the trembling River:\nAnd over the valleys; from the hills of Hertfordshire to the hills\nOf Surrey across Middlesex & across Albions House\nOf Eternity! pale stood Albion at his eastern gate,\nPLATE 46\nLeaning against the pillars, & his discase rose from his skirts\nUpon the Precipice he stood! ready to fall into Non-Entity.\nLos was all astonishment & terror: he trembled sitting on the Stone\nOf London: but the interiors of Albions fibres & nerves were hidden\nFrom Los; astonishd be beheld only the petrified surfaces:\nAnd saw his Furnaces in ruins, for Los is the Demon of the Furnaces;\nHe saw also the Four Points of Albion reversd inwards\nHe siezd his Hammer & Tongs, his iron Poker & his Bellows,\nUpon the valleys of Middlesex, Shouting loud for aid Divine.\nIn stern defiance came from Albions bosom Hand, Hyle, Koban,\nGwantok, Peachy, Brertun, Slaid, Huttn, Skofeld, Kock, Kotope\nBowen: Albions Sons: they bore him a golden couch into the porch\nAnd on the Couch reposd his limbs, trembling from the bloody field.\nRearing their Druid Patriarchal rocky Temples around his limbs.\n(All things begin & end, in Albions Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.)\nPLATE 47\nWhen Albion utterd his last words Hope is banishd from me\nFrom Camberwell to Highgate where the mighty Thames shudders along,\nWhere Los's Furnaces stand, where Jerusalem & Vala howl:\nLuvah tore forth from Albions Loins, in fibrous veins, in rivers\nOf blood over Europe: a Vegetating Root in grinding pain.\nAnimating the Dragon Temples, soon to become that Holy Fiend\nThe Wicker Man of Scandinavia in which cruelly consumed\nThe Captives reard to heaven howl in flames among the stars\nLoud the cries of War on the Rhine & Danube, with Albions Sons,\nAway from Beulahs hills & vales break forth the Souls of the Dead,\nWith cymbal, trumpet, clarion; & the scythed chariots of Britain.\nAnd the Veil of Vala, is composed of the Spectres of the Dead\nHark! the mingling cries of Luvah with the Sons of Albion\nHark! & Record the terrible wonder! that the Punisher\nMingles with his Victims Spectre, enslaved and tormented\nTo him whom he has murderd, bound in vengeance & enmity\nPLATE 48\nThese were his last words, and the merciful Saviour in his arms\nReciev'd him, in the arms of tender mercy and repos'd\nThe pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality\nUpon the Rock of Ages. Then, surrounded with a Cloud:\nIn silence the Divine Lord builded with immortal labour,\nOf gold & jewels a sublime Ornament, a Couch of repose,\nWith Sixteen pillars: canopied with emblems & written verse.\nSpiritual Verse, order'd & measur'd, from whence, time shall reveal.\nThe Five books of the Decologue, the books of Joshua & Judges,\nSamuel, a double book & Kings, a double book, the Psalms & Prophets\nThe Four-fold Gospel, and the Revelations everlasting\nEternity groan'd. & was troubled, at the image of Eternal Death!\nBeneath the bottoms of the Graves, which is Earths central joint,\nThere is a place where Contrarieties are equally true:\n(To protect from the Giant blows in the sports of intellect,\nThunder in the midst of kindness, & love that kills its beloved:\nBecause Death is for a period, and they renew tenfold.)\nFrom this sweet Place Maternal Love awoke Jerusalem\nWith pangs she forsook Beulah's pleasant lovely shadowy Universe\nWhere no dispute can come; created for those who Sleep.\nWeeping was in all Beulah, and all the Daughters of Beulah\nWept for their Sister the Daughter of Albion, Jerusalem:\nWhen out of Beulah the Emanation of the Sleeper descended\nWith solemn mourning out of Beulahs moony shades and hills:\nWithin the Human Heart, whose Gates closed with solemn sound.\nAnd this the manner of the terrible Separation\nThe Emanations of the grievously afflicted Friends of Albion\nConcenter in one Female form an Aged pensive Woman.\nAstonish'd! lovely! embracing the sublime shade: the Daughters of Beulah\nBeheld her with wonder! With awful hands she took\nA Moment of Time, drawing it out with many tears & afflictions\nAnd many sorrows: oblique across the Atlantic Vale\nWhich is the Vale of Rephaim dreadful from East to West,\nWhere the Human Harvest waves abundant in the beams of Eden\nInto a Rainbow of jewels and gold, a mild Reflection from\nAlbions dread Tomb. Eight thousand and five hundred years\nIn its extension. Every two hundred years has a door to Eden\nShe also took an Atom of Space, with dire pain opening it a Center\nInto Beulah: trembling the Daughters of Beulah dried\nHer tears. she ardent embrac'd her sorrows. occupied in labours\nOf sublime mercy in Rephaims Vale. Perusing Albions Tomb\nShe sat: she walk'd among the ornaments solemn mourning.\nThe Daughters attended her shudderings, wiping the death sweat\nLos also saw her in his seventh Furnace, he also terrified\nSaw the finger of God go forth upon his seventh Furnace:\nAway from the Starry Wheels to prepare Jerusalem a place.\nWhen with a dreadful groan the Emanation mild of Albion.\nBurst from his bosom in the Tomb like a pale snowy cloud,\nFemale and lovely, struggling to put off the Human form\nWrithing in pain. The Daughters of Beulah in kind arms reciev'd\nJerusalem: weeping over her among the Spaces of Erin,\nIn the Ends of Beulah, where the Dead wail night & day.\nAnd thus Erin spoke to the Daughters of Beulah, in soft tears\nAlbion the Vortex of the Dead!

{"title": "Calidore: A Fragment", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;\nHis healthful spirit eager and awake\nTo feel the beauty of a silent eve,\nWhich seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;\nThe light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.\nHe bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,\nAnd smiles at the far clearness all around,\nUntil his heart is well nigh over wound,\nAnd turns for calmness to the pleasant green\nOf easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean\nSo elegantly o'er the waters' brim\nAnd show their blossoms trim.\nThe freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,\nDelighting much, to see it half at rest,\nDip so refreshingly its wings, and breast\n'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon,\nThe widening circles into nothing gone.\nAnd now the sharp keel of his little boat\nComes up with ripple, and with easy float,\nAnd glides into a bed of water lillies:\nBroad leav'd are they and their white canopies\nAre upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.\nNear to a little island's point they grew;\nWhence Calidore might have the goodliest view\nOf this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore\nWent off in gentle windings to the hoar\nAnd light blue mountains: but no breathing man\nWith a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan\nNature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by\nObjects that look'd out so invitingly\nOn either side. These, gentle Calidore\nGreeted, as he had known them long before.\nThe sidelong view of swelling leafiness,\nWhich the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress;\nWhence ever, and anon the jay outsprings,\nAnd scales upon the beauty of its wings.\nThe lonely turret, shatter'd, and outworn,\nStands venerably proud; too proud to mourn\nIts long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around,\nAye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.\nThe little chapel with the cross above\nUpholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,\nThat on the windows spreads his feathers light,\nAnd seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.\nGreen tufted islands casting their soft shades\nAcross the lake; sequester\u2019d leafy glades,\nThat through the dimness of their twilight show\nLarge dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow\nOf the wild cat\u2019s eyes, or the silvery stems\nOf delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems\nA little brook. The youth had long been viewing\nThese pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing\nThe mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught\nA trumpet's silver voice. Ah! it was fraught\nWith many joys for him: the warder's ken\nHad found white coursers prancing in the glen:\nFriends very dear to him he soon will see;\nSo pushes off his boat most eagerly,\nAnd soon upon the lake he skims along,\nDeaf to the nightingale\u2019s first under-song;\nNor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:\nHis spirit flies before him so completely.\nAnd now he turns a jutting point of land,\nWhence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand:\nNor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,\nBefore the point of his light shallop reaches\nThose marble steps that through the water dip:\nNow over them he goes with hasty trip,\nAnd scarcely stays to ope the folding doors:\nAnon he leaps along the oaken floors\nOf halls and corridors.\nDelicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things\nThat float about the air on azure wings,\nHad been less heartfelt by him than the clang\nOf clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,\nJust as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,\nWere slanting out their necks with loosened rein;\nWhile from beneath the threat'ning portcullis\nThey brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,\nWhat gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!\nHow tremblingly their delicate ancles spann\u2019d!\nInto how sweet a trance his soul was gone,\nWhile whisperings of affection\nMade him delay to let their tender feet\nCome to the earth; with an incline so sweet\nFrom their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent:\nAnd whether there were tears of languishment,\nOr that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,\nHe feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses\nWith lips that tremble, and with glistening eye\nAll the soft luxury\nThat nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,\nFair as some wonder out of fairy land,\nHung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers\nOf whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers:\nAnd this he fondled with his happy cheek\nAs if for joy he would no further seek;\nWhen the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond\nCame to his ear, like something from beyond\nHis present being: so he gently drew\nHis warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,\nFrom their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,\nThank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;\nWhile 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd\nA hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;\nA hand that from the world's bleak promontory\nHad lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.\nAmid the pages, and the torches' glare,\nThere stood a knight, patting the flowing hair\nOf his proud horse's mane: he was withal\nA man of elegance, and stature tall:\nSo that the waving of his plumes would be\nHigh as the berries of a wild ash tree,\nOr as the winged cap of Mercury.\nHis armour was so dexterously wrought\nIn shape, that sure no living man had thought\nIt hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed\nIt was some glorious form, some splendid weed,\nIn which a spirit new come from the skies\nMight live, and show itself to human eyes.\n'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,\nSaid the good man to Calidore alert;\nWhile the young warrior with a step of grace\nCame up,--a courtly smile upon his face,\nAnd mailed hand held out, ready to greet\nThe large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat\nOf the aspiring boy; who as he led\nThose smiling ladies, often turned his head\nTo admire the visor arched so gracefully\nOver a knightly brow; while they went by\nThe lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,\nAnd gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.\nSoon in a pleasant chamber they are seated;\nThe sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted\nAll the green leaves that round the window clamber,\nTo show their purple stars, and bells of amber.\nSir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,\nGladdening in the free, and airy feel\nOf a light mantle; and while Clerimond\nIs looking round about him with a fond,\nAnd placid eye, young Calidore is burning\nTo hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning\nOf all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm\nKept off dismay, and terror, and alarm\nFrom lovely woman: while brimful of this,\nHe gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,\nAnd had such manly ardour in his eye,\nThat each at other look'd half staringly;\nAnd then their features started into smiles\nSweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.\nSoftly the breezes from the forest came,\nSoftly they blew aside the taper's flame;\nClear was the song from Philomel's far bower;\nGrateful the incense from the lime-tree flower;\nMysterious, wild, the far-heard trumpet's tone;\nLovely the moon in ether, all alone:\nSweet too the converse of these happy mortals,\nAs that of busy spirits when the portals\nAre closing in the west; or that soft humming\nWe hear around when Hesperus is coming.\nSweet be their sleep. * * * * * * * * *\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Calidore:-A-Fragment"}

{"title": "Endymion: Book I", "author": "John Keats", "text": "A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\nOf all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\nPouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\nNor do we merely feel these essences\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\nDear as the temple's self, so does the moon,\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast,\nThat, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,\nThey alway must be with us, or we die.\nTherefore, 'tis with full happiness that I\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\nThe very music of the name has gone\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\nOf our own vallies: so I will begin\nNow while I cannot hear the city's din;\nNow while the early budders are just new,\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\nI must be near the middle of my story.\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\nSee it half finished: but let Autumn bold,\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\nBe all about me when I make an end.\nAnd now at once, adventuresome, I send\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed.\nUpon the sides of Latmos was outspread\nA mighty forest; for the moist earth fed\nSo plenteously all weed-hidden roots\nInto o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.\nAnd it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,\nWhere no man went; and if from shepherd's keep\nA lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,\nNever again saw he the happy pens\nWhither his brethren, bleating with content,\nOver the hills at every nightfall went.\nAmong the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,\nThat not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever\nFrom the white flock, but pass'd unworried\nBy angry wolf, or pard with prying head,\nUntil it came to some unfooted plains\nWhere fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains\nWho thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,\nWinding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,\nAnd ivy banks; all leading pleasantly\nTo a wide lawn, whence one could only see\nStems thronging all around between the swell\nOf turf and slanting branches: who could tell\nThe freshness of the space of heaven above,\nEdg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove\nWould often beat its wings, and often too\nA little cloud would move across the blue.\nFull in the middle of this pleasantness\nThere stood a marble altar, with a tress\nOf flowers budded newly; and the dew\nHad taken fairy phantasies to strew\nDaisies upon the sacred sward last eve,\nAnd so the dawned light in pomp receive.\nFor 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire\nMade every eastern cloud a silvery pyre\nOf brightness so unsullied, that therein\nA melancholy spirit well might win\nOblivion, and melt out his essence fine\nInto the winds: rain-scented eglantine\nGave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;\nThe lark was lost in him; cold springs had run\nTo warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;\nMan's voice was on the mountains; and the mass\nOf nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,\nTo feel this sun-rise and its glories old.\nNow while the silent workings of the dawn\nWere busiest, into that self-same lawn\nAll suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped\nA troop of little children garlanded;\nWho gathering round the altar, seemed to pry\nEarnestly round as wishing to espy\nSome folk of holiday: nor had they waited\nFor many moments, ere their ears were sated\nWith a faint breath of music, which ev'n then\nFill'd out its voice, and died away again.\nWithin a little space again it gave\nIts airy swellings, with a gentle wave,\nTo light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking\nThrough copse-clad vallies,\u2014ere their death, oer-taking\nThe surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\nAnd now, as deep into the wood as we\nMight mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light\nFair faces and a rush of garments white,\nPlainer and plainer shewing, till at last\nInto the widest alley they all past,\nMaking directly for the woodland altar.\nO kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter\nIn telling of this goodly company,\nOf their old piety, and of their glee:\nBut let a portion of ethereal dew\nFall on my head, and presently unmew\nMy soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,\nTo stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.\nLeading the way, young damsels danced along,\nBearing the burden of a shepherd song;\nEach having a white wicker over brimm'd\nWith April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,\nA crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks\nAs may be read of in Arcadian books;\nSuch as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,\nWhen the great deity, for earth too ripe,\nLet his divinity o'er-flowing die\nIn music, through the vales of Thessaly:\nSome idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,\nAnd some kept up a shrilly mellow sound\nWith ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,\nNow coming from beneath the forest trees,\nA venerable priest full soberly,\nBegirt with ministring looks: alway his eye\nStedfast upon the matted turf he kept,\nAnd after him his sacred vestments swept.\nFrom his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,\nOf mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;\nAnd in his left he held a basket full\nOf all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:\nWild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still\nThan Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.\nHis aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,\nSeem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth\nOf winter hoar. Then came another crowd\nOf shepherds, lifting in due time aloud\nTheir share of the ditty. After them appear'd,\nTheir voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,\nEasily rolling so as scarce to mar\nThe freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:\nWho stood therein did seem of great renown\nAmong the throng. His youth was fully blown,\nShewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;\nAnd, for those simple times, his garments were\nA chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,\nWas hung a silver bugle, and between\nHis nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.\nA smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,\nTo common lookers on, like one who dream'd\nOf idleness in groves Elysian:\nBut there were some who feelingly could scan\nA lurking trouble in his nether lip,\nAnd see that oftentimes the reins would slip\nThrough his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,\nAnd think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,\nOf logs piled solemnly.\u2014Ah, well-a-day,\nWhy should our young Endymion pine away!\nSoon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,\nStood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd\nTo sudden veneration: women meek\nBeckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek\nOf virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.\nEndymion too, without a forest peer,\nStood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,\nAmong his brothers of the mountain chase.\nIn midst of all, the venerable priest\nEyed them with joy from greatest to the least,\nAnd, after lifting up his aged hands,\nThus spake he: \"Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!\nWhose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:\nWhether descended from beneath the rocks\nThat overtop your mountains; whether come\nFrom vallies where the pipe is never dumb;\nOr from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs\nBlue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze\nBuds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge\nNibble their fill at ocean's very marge,\nWhose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn\nBy the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:\nMothers and wives! who day by day prepare\nThe scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;\nAnd all ye gentle girls who foster up\nUdderless lambs, and in a little cup\nWill put choice honey for a favoured youth:\nYea, every one attend! for in good truth\nOur vows are wanting to our great god Pan.\nAre not our lowing heifers sleeker than\nNight-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains\nSpeckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains\nGreen'd over April's lap? No howling sad\nSickens our fearful ewes; and we have had\nGreat bounty from Endymion our lord.\nThe earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd\nHis early song against yon breezy sky,\nThat spreads so clear o'er our solemnity.\"\nThus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire\nOf teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;\nAnon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod\nWith wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.\nNow while the earth was drinking it, and while\nBay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,\nAnd gummy frankincense was sparkling bright\n'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light\nSpread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:\n\"O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang\nFrom jagged trunks, and overshadoweth\nEternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death\nOf unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;\nWho lov'st to see the hamadryads dress\nTheir ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;\nAnd through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken\nThe dreary melody of bedded reeds\u2014\nIn desolate places, where dank moisture breeds\nThe pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;\nBethinking thee, how melancholy loth\nThou wast to lose fair Syrinx\u2014do thou now,\nBy thy love's milky brow!\nBy all the trembling mazes that she ran,\nHear us, great Pan!\n\"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles\nPassion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,\nWhat time thou wanderest at eventide\nThrough sunny meadows, that outskirt the side\nOf thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom\nBroad leaved fig trees even now foredoom\nTheir ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees\nTheir golden honeycombs; our village leas\nTheir fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;\nThe chuckling linnet its five young unborn,\nTo sing for thee; low creeping strawberries\nTheir summer coolness; pent up butterflies\nTheir freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year\nAll its completions\u2014be quickly near,\nBy every wind that nods the mountain pine,\nO forester divine!\n\"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies\nFor willing service; whether to surprise\nThe squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;\nOr upward ragged precipices flit\nTo save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;\nOr by mysterious enticement draw\nBewildered shepherds to their path again;\nOr to tread breathless round the frothy main,\nAnd gather up all fancifullest shells\nFor thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,\nAnd, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;\nOr to delight thee with fantastic leaping,\nThe while they pelt each other on the crown\nWith silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown\u2014\nBy all the echoes that about thee ring,\nHear us, O satyr king!\n\"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,\nWhile ever and anon to his shorn peers\nA ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,\nWhen snouted wild-boars routing tender corn\nAnger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,\nTo keep off mildews, and all weather harms:\nStrange ministrant of undescribed sounds,\nThat come a swooning over hollow grounds,\nAnd wither drearily on barren moors:\nDread opener of the mysterious doors\nLeading to universal knowledge\u2014see,\nGreat son of Dryope,\nThe many that are come to pay their vows\nWith leaves about their brows!\nBe still the unimaginable lodge\nFor solitary thinkings; such as dodge\nConception to the very bourne of heaven,\nThen leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,\nThat spreading in this dull and clodded earth\nGives it a touch ethereal\u2014a new birth:\nBe still a symbol of immensity;\nA firmament reflected in a sea;\nAn element filling the space between;\nAn unknown\u2014but no more: we humbly screen\nWith uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,\nAnd giving out a shout most heaven rending,\nConjure thee to receive our humble Paean,\nUpon thy Mount Lycean!\nEven while they brought the burden to a close,\nA shout from the whole multitude arose,\nThat lingered in the air like dying rolls\nOf abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals\nOf dolphins bob their noses through the brine.\nMeantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,\nYoung companies nimbly began dancing\nTo the swift treble pipe, and humming string.\nAye, those fair living forms swam heavenly\nTo tunes forgotten\u2014out of memory:\nFair creatures! whose young children's children bred\nThermopyl\u00e6 its heroes\u2014not yet dead,\nBut in old marbles ever beautiful.\nHigh genitors, unconscious did they cull\nTime's sweet first-fruits\u2014they danc'd to weariness,\nAnd then in quiet circles did they press\nThe hillock turf, and caught the latter end\nOf some strange history, potent to send\nA young mind from its bodily tenement.\nOr they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent\nOn either side; pitying the sad death\nOf Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath\nOf Zephyr slew him,\u2014Zephyr penitent,\nWho now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,\nFondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\nThe archers too, upon a wider plain,\nBeside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,\nAnd the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft\nBranch down sweeping from a tall ash top,\nCall'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope\nThose who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee\nAnd frantic gape of lonely Niobe,\nPoor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young\nWere dead and gone, and her caressing tongue\nLay a lost thing upon her paly lip,\nAnd very, very deadliness did nip\nHer motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood\nBy one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,\nUplifting his strong bow into the air,\nMany might after brighter visions stare:\nAfter the Argonauts, in blind amaze\nTossing about on Neptune's restless ways,\nUntil, from the horizon's vaulted side,\nThere shot a golden splendour far and wide,\nSpangling those million poutings of the brine\nWith quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine\nFrom the exaltation of Apollo's bow;\nA heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.\nWho thus were ripe for high contemplating,\nMight turn their steps towards the sober ring\nWhere sat Endymion and the aged priest\n'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd\nThe silvery setting of their mortal star.\nThere they discours'd upon the fragile bar\nThat keeps us from our homes ethereal;\nAnd what our duties there: to nightly call\nVesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;\nTo summon all the downiest clouds together\nFor the sun's purple couch; to emulate\nIn ministring the potent rule of fate\nWith speed of fire-tailed exhalations;\nTo tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons\nSweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,\nA world of other unguess'd offices.\nAnon they wander'd, by divine converse,\nInto Elysium; vieing to rehearse\nEach one his own anticipated bliss.\nOne felt heart-certain that he could not miss\nHis quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,\nWhere every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows\nHer lips with music for the welcoming.\nAnother wish'd, mid that eternal spring,\nTo meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,\nSweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:\nWho, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,\nAnd with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;\nAnd, ever after, through those regions be\nHis messenger, his little Mercury.\nSome were athirst in soul to see again\nTheir fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign\nIn times long past; to sit with them, and talk\nOf all the chances in their earthly walk;\nOf happiness, to when upon the moors,\nBenighted, close they huddled from the cold,\nAnd shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told\nTheir fond imaginations,\u2014saving him\nWhose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,\nEndymion: yet hourly had he striven\nTo hide the cankering venom, that had riven\nHis fainting recollections. Now indeed\nHis senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed\nThe sudden silence, or the whispers low,\nOr the old eyes dissolving at his woe,\nOr anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,\nOr maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:\nBut in the self-same fixed trance he kept,\nLike one who on the earth had never stept.\nAye, even as dead-still as a marble man,\nFrozen in that old tale Arabian.\nWho whispers him so pantingly and close?\nPeona, his sweet sister: of all those,\nHis friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,\nAnd breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade\nA yielding up, a cradling on her care.\nHer eloquence did breathe away the curse:\nShe led him, like some midnight spirit nurse\nOf happy changes in emphatic dreams,\nAlong a path between two little streams,\u2014\nGuarding his forehead, with her round elbow,\nFrom low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow\nFrom stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;\nUntil they came to where these streamlets fall,\nWith mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,\nInto a river, clear, brimful, and flush\nWith crystal mocking of the trees and sky.\nA little shallop, floating there hard by,\nPointed its beak over the fringed bank;\nAnd soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,\nAnd dipt again, with the young couple's weight,\u2014\nPeona guiding, through the water straight,\nTowards a bowery island opposite;\nWhich gaining presently, she steered light\nInto a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,\nWhere nested was an arbour, overwove\nBy many a summer's silent fingering;\nTo whose cool bosom she was used to bring\nHer playmates, with their needle broidery,\nAnd minstrel memories of times gone by.\nSo she was gently glad to see him laid\nUnder her favourite bower's quiet shade,\nOn her own couch, new made of flower leaves,\nDried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves\nWhen last the sun his autumn tresses shook,\nAnd the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.\nSoon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:\nBut, ere it crept upon him, he had prest\nPeona's busy hand against his lips,\nAnd still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips\nIn tender pressure. And as a willow keeps\nA patient watch over the stream that creeps\nWindingly by it, so the quiet maid\nHeld her in peace: so that a whispering blade\nOf grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling\nDown in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling\nAmong seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.\nO magic sleep! O comfortable bird,\nThat broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind\nTill it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd\nRestraint! imprisoned liberty! great key\nTo golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,\nFountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,\nEchoing grottos, full of tumbling waves\nAnd moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world\nOf silvery enchantment!\u2014who, upfurl'd\nBeneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,\nBut renovates and lives?\u2014Thus, in the bower,\nEndymion was calm'd to life again.\nOpening his eyelids with a healthier brain,\nHe said: \"I feel this thine endearing love\nAll through my bosom: thou art as a dove\nTrembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings\nAbout me; and the pearliest dew not brings\nSuch morning incense from the fields of May,\nAs do those brighter drops that twinkling stray\nFrom those kind eyes,\u2014the very home and haunt\nOf sisterly affection. Can I want\nAught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?\nYet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears\nThat, any longer, I will pass my days\nAlone and sad. No, I will once more raise\nMy voice upon the mountain-heights; once more\nMake my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:\nAgain my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll\nAround the breathed boar: again I'll poll\nThe fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:\nAnd, when the pleasant sun is getting low,\nAgain I'll linger in a sloping mead\nTo hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed\nOur idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,\nAnd, if thy lute is here, softly intreat\nMy soul to keep in its resolved course.\"\nHereat Peona, in their silver source,\nShut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,\nAnd took a lute, from which there pulsing came\nA lively prelude, fashioning the way\nIn which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay\nMore subtle cadenced, more forest wild\nThan Dryope's lone lulling of her child;\nAnd nothing since has floated in the air\nSo mournful strange. Surely some influence rare\nWent, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;\nFor still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd\nThe quick invisible strings, even though she saw\nEndymion's spirit melt away and thaw\nBefore the deep intoxication.\nBut soon she came, with sudden burst, upon\nHer self-possession\u2014swung the lute aside,\nAnd earnestly said: \"Brother, 'tis vain to hide\nThat thou dost know of things mysterious,\nImmortal, starry; such alone could thus\nWeigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught\nOffensive to the heavenly powers? Caught\nA Paphian dove upon a message sent?\nThy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,\nSacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen\nHer naked limbs among the alders green;\nAnd that, alas! is death. No, I can trace\nSomething more high perplexing in thy face!\"\nEndymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,\nAnd said, \"Art thou so pale, who wast so bland\nAnd merry in our meadows? How is this?\nTell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!\u2014\nAh! thou hast been unhappy at the change\nWrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?\nOr more complete to overwhelm surmise?\nAmbition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,\nThat toiling years would put within my grasp,\nThat I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp\nNo man e'er panted for a mortal love.\nSo all have set my heavier grief above\nThese things which happen. Rightly have they done:\nI, who still saw the horizontal sun\nHeave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,\nOut-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd\nMy spear aloft, as signal for the chace\u2014\nI, who, for very sport of heart, would race\nWith my own steed from Araby; pluck down\nA vulture from his towery perching; frown\nA lion into growling, loth retire\u2014\nTo lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,\nAnd sink thus low! but I will ease my breast\nOf secret grief, here in this bowery nest.\n\"This river does not see the naked sky,\nTill it begins to progress silverly\nAround the western border of the wood,\nWhence, from a certain spot, its winding flood\nSeems at the distance like a crescent moon:\nAnd in that nook, the very pride of June,\nHad I been used to pass my weary eves;\nThe rather for the sun unwilling leaves\nSo dear a picture of his sovereign power,\nAnd I could witness his most kingly hour,\nWhen he doth lighten up the golden reins,\nAnd paces leisurely down amber plains\nHis snorting four. Now when his chariot last\nIts beams against the zodiac-lion cast,\nThere blossom'd suddenly a magic bed\nOf sacred ditamy, and poppies red:\nAt which I wondered greatly, knowing well\nThat but one night had wrought this flowery spell;\nAnd, sitting down close by, began to muse\nWhat it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,\nIn passing here, his owlet pinions shook;\nOr, it may be, ere matron Night uptook\nHer ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,\nHad dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth\nCame not by common growth. Thus on I thought,\nUntil my head was dizzy and distraught.\nMoreover, through the dancing poppies stole\nA breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;\nAnd shaping visions all about my sight\nOf colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;\nThe which became more strange, and strange, and dim,\nAnd then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:\nAnd then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell\nThe enchantment that afterwards befel?\nYet it was but a dream: yet such a dream\nThat never tongue, although it overteem\nWith mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,\nCould figure out and to conception bring\nAll I beheld and felt. Methought I lay\nWatching the zenith, where the milky way\nAmong the stars in virgin splendour pours;\nAnd travelling my eye, until the doors\nOf heaven appear'd to open for my flight,\nI became loth and fearful to alight\nFrom such high soaring by a downward glance:\nSo kept me stedfast in that airy trance,\nSpreading imaginary pinions wide.\nWhen, presently, the stars began to glide,\nAnd faint away, before my eager view:\nAt which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,\nAnd dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;\nAnd lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge\nThe loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er\nA shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar\nSo passionately bright, my dazzled soul\nCommingling with her argent spheres did roll\nThrough clear and cloudy, even when she went\nAt last into a dark and vapoury tent\u2014\nWhereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train\nOf planets all were in the blue again.\nTo commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd\nMy sight right upward: but it was quite dazed\nBy a bright something, sailing down apace,\nMaking me quickly veil my eyes and face:\nAgain I look'd, and, O ye deities,\nWho from Olympus watch our destinies!\nWhence that completed form of all completeness?\nWhence came that high perfection of all sweetness?\nSpeak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where\nHast thou a symbol of her golden hair?\nNot oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;\nNot\u2014thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun\nSuch follying before thee\u2014yet she had,\nIndeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;\nAnd they were simply gordian'd up and braided,\nLeaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,\nHer pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;\nThe which were blended in, I know not how,\nWith such a paradise of lips and eyes,\nBlush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,\nThat, when I think thereon, my spirit clings\nAnd plays about its fancy, till the stings\nOf human neighbourhood envenom all.\nUnto what awful power shall I call?\nTo what high fane?\u2014Ah! see her hovering feet,\nMore bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet\nThan those of sea-born Venus, when she rose\nFrom out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows\nHer scarf into a fluttering pavilion;\n'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million\nOf little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,\nOver the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,\nHandfuls of daisies.\"\u2014\"Endymion, how strange!\nDream within dream!\"\u2014\"She took an airy range,\nAnd then, towards me, like a very maid,\nCame blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,\nAnd press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;\nMethought I fainted at the charmed touch,\nYet held my recollection, even as one\nWho dives three fathoms where the waters run\nGurgling in beds of coral: for anon,\nI felt upmounted in that region\nWhere falling stars dart their artillery forth,\nAnd eagles struggle with the buffeting north\nThat balances the heavy meteor-stone;\u2014\nFelt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,\nBut lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.\nSoon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,\nAnd straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;\nSuch as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd\nHuge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:\nThere hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd\nTo faint once more by looking on my bliss\u2014\nI was distracted; madly did I kiss\nThe wooing arms which held me, and did give\nMy eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,\nTo take in draughts of life from the gold fount\nOf kind and passionate looks; to count, and count\nA second self, that each might be redeem'd\nAnd plunder'd of its load of blessedness.\nAh, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press\nHer very cheek against my crowned lip,\nAnd, at that moment, felt my body dip\nInto a warmer air: a moment more,\nOf newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes\nA scent of violets, and blossoming limes,\nLoiter'd around us; then of honey cells,\nMade delicate from all white-flower bells;\nAnd once, above the edges of our nest,\nAn arch face peep'd,\u2014an Oread as I guess'd.\n\"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me\nIn midst of all this heaven? Why not see,\nFar off, the shadows of his pinions dark,\nAnd stare them from me? But no, like a spark\nThat needs must die, although its little beam\nReflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream\nFell into nothing\u2014into stupid sleep.\nAnd so it was, until a gentle creep,\nA careful moving caught my waking ears,\nAnd up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,\nMy clenched hands;\u2014for lo! the poppies hung\nDew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung\nA heavy ditty, and the sullen day\nHad chidden herald Hesperus away,\nWith leaden looks: the solitary breeze\nBluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze\nWith wayward melancholy; and r thought,\nMark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought\nFaint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!\u2014\nAway I wander'd\u2014all the pleasant hues\nOf heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades\nWere deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades\nWere full of pestilent light; our taintless rills\nSeem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills\nOf dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown\nIn frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown\nLike spiked aloe. If an innocent bird\nBefore my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd\nIn little journeys, I beheld in it\nA disguis'd demon, missioned to knit\nMy soul with under darkness; to entice\nMy stumblings down some monstrous precipice:\nThe disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,\nRock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!\nThese things, with all their comfortings, are given\nTo my down-sunken hours, and with thee,\nOf weary life.\"\nThus ended he, and both\nSat silent: for the maid was very loth\nTo answer; feeling well that breathed words\nWould all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords\nAgainst the enchased crocodile, or leaps\nOf grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,\nAnd wonders; struggles to devise some blame;\nTo put on such a look as would say, Shame\nOn this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,\nShe could as soon have crush'd away the life\nFrom a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,\nShe said with trembling chance: \"Is this the cause?\nThis all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!\nThat one who through this middle earth should pass\nMost like a sojourning demi-god, and leave\nHis name upon the harp-string, should achieve\nNo higher bard than simple maidenhood,\nSinging alone, and fearfully,\u2014how the blood\nLeft his young cheek; and how he used to stray\nHe knew not where; and how he would say, nay,\nIf any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;\nWhat could it be but love? How a ring-dove\nLet fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;\nAnd how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,\nThe gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;\nAnd then the ballad of his sad life closes\nWith sighs, and an alas!\u2014Endymion!\nBe rather in the trumpet's mouth,\u2014anon\nAmong the winds at large\u2014that all may hearken!\nAlthough, before the crystal heavens darken,\nI watch and dote upon the silver lakes\nPictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes\nThe semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,\nIslands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands\nWith horses prancing o'er them, palaces\nAnd towers of amethyst,\u2014would I so tease\nMy pleasant days, because I could not mount\nInto those regions? The Morphean fount\nOf that fine element that visions, dreams,\nAnd fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams\nInto its airy channels with so subtle,\nSo thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,\nCircled a million times within the space\nOf a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,\nA tinting of its quality: how light\nMust dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight\nThan the mere nothing that engenders them!\nThen wherefore sully the entrusted gem\nOf high and noble life with thoughts so sick?\nWhy pierce high-fronted honour to the quick\nFor nothing but a dream?\" Hereat the youth\nLook'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth\nWas in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids\nWidened a little, as when Zephyr bids\nA little breeze to creep between the fans\nOf careless butterflies: amid his pains\nHe seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,\nFull palatable; and a colour grew\nUpon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.\n\"Peona! ever have I long'd to slake\nMy thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,\nNo merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace\nThe stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd\u2014\nThough now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd\nAnd sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope\nIs of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,\nTo fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.\nWherein lies happiness? In that which becks\nOur ready minds to fellowship divine,\nA fellowship with essence; till we shine,\nFull alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold\nThe clear religion of heaven! Fold\nA rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,\nAnd soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress\nOf music's kiss impregnates the free winds,\nAnd with a sympathetic touch unbinds\nEolian magic from their lucid wombs:\nThen old songs waken from enclouded tombs;\nOld ditties sigh above their father's grave;\nGhosts of melodious prophecyings rave\nRound every spot where trod Apollo's foot;\nBronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,\nWhere long ago a giant battle was;\nAnd, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass\nIn every place where infant Orpheus slept.\nFeel we these things?\u2014that moment have we stept\nInto a sort of oneness, and our state\nIs like a floating spirit's. But there are\nRicher entanglements, enthralments far\nMore self-destroying, leading, by degrees,\nTo the chief intensity: the crown of these\nIs made of love and friendship, and sits high\nUpon the forehead of humanity.\nAll its more ponderous and bulky worth\nIs friendship, whence there ever issues forth\nA steady splendour; but at the tip-top,\nThere hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop\nOf light, and that is love: its influence,\nThrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,\nAt which we start and fret; till in the end,\nMelting into its radiance, we blend,\nMingle, and so become a part of it,\u2014\nNor with aught else can our souls interknit\nSo wingedly: when we combine therewith,\nLife's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,\nAnd we are nurtured like a pelican brood.\nAye, so delicious is the unsating food,\nThat men, who might have tower'd in the van\nOf all the congregated world, to fan\nAnd winnow from the coming step of time\nAll chaff of custom, wipe away all slime\nLeft by men-slugs and human serpentry,\nHave been content to let occasion die,\nWhilst they did sleep in love's elysium.\nAnd, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,\nThan speak against this ardent listlessness:\nFor I have ever thought that it might bless\nThe world with benefits unknowingly;\nAs does the nightingale, upperched high,\nAnd cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves\u2014\nShe sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives\nHow tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.\nJust so may love, although 'tis understood\nThe mere commingling of passionate breath,\nProduce more than our searching witnesseth:\nWhat I know not: but who, of men, can tell\nThat flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell\nTo melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,\nThe earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,\nThe meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,\nThe seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,\nTones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,\nIf human souls did never kiss and greet?\n\"Now, if this earthly love has power to make\nMen's being mortal, immortal; to shake\nAmbition from their memories, and brim\nTheir measure of content; what merest whim,\nSeems all this poor endeavour after fame,\nTo one, who keeps within his stedfast aim\nA love immortal, an immortal too.\nLook not so wilder'd; for these things are true,\nAnd never can be born of atomies\nThat buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,\nLeaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,\nMy restless spirit never could endure\nTo brood so long upon one luxury,\nUnless it did, though fearfully, espy\nA hope beyond the shadow of a dream.\nMy sayings will the less obscured seem,\nWhen I have told thee how my waking sight\nHas made me scruple whether that same night\nWas pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!\nBeyond the matron-temple of Latona,\nWhich we should see but for these darkening boughs,\nLies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows\nBushes and trees do lean all round athwart,\nAnd meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,\nAnd spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide\nPast them, but he must brush on every side.\nSome moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,\nFar as the slabbed margin of a well,\nWhose patient level peeps its crystal eye\nRight upward, through the bushes, to the sky.\nOft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set\nLike vestal primroses, but dark velvet\nEdges them round, and they have golden pits:\n'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits\nIn a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,\nWhen all above was faint with mid-day heat.\nAnd there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,\nI'd bubble up the water through a reed;\nSo reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships\nOf moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,\nWith leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be\nOf their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,\nWhen love-lorn hours had left me less a child,\nI sat contemplating the figures wild\nOf o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.\nUpon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew\nA cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;\nSo plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver\nThe happy chance: so happy, I was fain\nAnd, therefore, was just going; when, behold!\nA wonder, fair as any I have told\u2014\nThe same bright face I tasted in my sleep,\nSmiling in the clear well. My heart did leap\nThrough the cool depth.\u2014It moved as if to flee\u2014\nI started up, when lo! refreshfully,\nThere came upon my face, in plenteous showers,\nDew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,\nWrapping all objects from my smothered sight,\nBathing my spirit in a new delight.\nAye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss\nAlone preserved me from the drear abyss\nOf death, for the fair form had gone again.\nPleasure is oft a visitant; but pain\nClings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth\nOn the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,\n'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.\nHow sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure\nOf weary days, made deeper exquisite,\nBy a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!\nLike sorrow came upon me, heavier still,\nThan when I wander'd from the poppy hill:\nAnd a whole age of lingering moments crept\nSluggishly by, ere more contentment swept\nAway at once the deadly yellow spleen.\nYes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;\nOnce more been tortured with renewed life.\nWhen last the wintry gusts gave over strife\nWith the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies\nWarm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes\nIn pity of the shatter'd infant buds,\u2014\nThat time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,\nMy hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,\nChatted with thee, and many days exil'd\nAll torment from my breast;\u2014'twas even then,\nStraying about, yet, coop'd up in the den\nAt last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,\nAnd, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck\nIn the middle of a brook,\u2014whose silver ramble\nDown twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,\nTracing along, it brought me to a cave,\nWhence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave\nThe nether sides of mossy stones and rock,\u2014\n'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock\nIts own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,\nHung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread\nThick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.\n\"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?\"\nSaid I, low voic'd: \"Ah whither! 'Tis the grot\nOf Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,\nDoth her resign; and where her tender hands\nShe dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:\nOr 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,\nAnd babbles thorough silence, till her wits\nAre gone in tender madness, and anon,\nFaints into sleep, with many a dying tone\nOf sadness. O that she would take my vows,\nAnd breathe them sighingly among the boughs,\nTo sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,\nDaily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,\nAnd weave them dyingly\u2014send honey-whispers\nRound every leaf, that all those gentle lispers\nMay sigh my love unto her pitying!\nO charitable echo! hear, and sing\nThis ditty to her!\u2014tell her\"\u2014so I stay'd\nMy foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,\nStood stupefied with my own empty folly,\nAnd blushing for the freaks of melancholy.\nSalt tears were coming, when I heard my name\nMost fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:\n\u2018Endymion! the cave is secreter\nThan the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir\nNo sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise\nOf thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys\nAnd trembles through my labyrinthine hair.\"\nAt that oppress'd I hurried in.\u2014Ah! where\nAre those swift moments? Whither are they fled?\nI'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed\nSorrow the way to death, but patiently\nBear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;\nAnd come instead demurest meditation,\nTo occupy me wholly, and to fashion\nMy pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.\nNo more will I count over, link by link,\nMy chain of grief: no longer strive to find\nA half-forgetfulness in mountain wind\nBlustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,\nDearest of sisters, what my life shall be;\nWhat a calm round of hours shall make my days.\nThere is a paly flame of hope that plays\nWhere'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught\u2014\nAnd here I bid it die. Have not I caught,\nAlready, a more healthy countenance?\nBy this the sun is setting; we may chance\nMeet some of our near-dwellers with my car.\"\nThis said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star\nThrough autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:\nThey stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.\nENDYMION.\nA Romance.\n\"The stretched metre of an antique song.\" ~\nShakspeare's Sonnets.\nINSCRIBED,\nWith Every Feeling Of Pride and Regret\nand With \"A Bowed Mind,\"\nTo the Memory of\nThe Most English of Poets Except Shakspeare,\nTHOMAS CHATTERON.\n------------------------\n(line 144): A lovely allusion to the story of Apollo's nine years' sojourn on earth as the herdsman of Admetus, when banished from Olympus for killing the Cyclops who had forged the thunder-bolts wherewith AEsculapius had been slain.\n(line 232): It was the Hymn to Pan beginning here that the young poet when engaged in the composition of Endymion was induced to recite in the presence of Wordsworth, on the 28th of December 1817, at Haydon's house. Leigh Hunt records that the elder poet pronounced it \"a very pretty piece of paganism.\"\n(line 319): Doubtless meant to refer specially to the Elgin marbles.\n(line 347): The reference here is to the passage from the second Book of the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius, beginning at verse 674 ... which Shelley had in mind when (Prose Works, Vol. 3, p. 56) he alluded to the Apollo \"so finely described by Apollonius Rhodius when the dazzling radiance of his beautiful limbs suddenly shone over the dark Euxine.\"\n__ note found before the Preface of Endymion, in the Poetical Works of John Keats, ed. H. Buxton Forman, Crowell publ. 1895. ...,\n'In Woodhouse's copy of Endymion there is a note against the passage \"so I will begin\" &c., line 39, Book I, to the effect that the poem was begun in the spring of 1817 and finished in the winter of 1817-18; and in the title-page he has inserted April before 1818. The statement corresponds with Keats's own record of May 1817, that he was busying himself at Margate with the commencement of Endymion.'\nPREFACE.\nKnowing within myself the manner in which this Poem has been produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it public.\nWhat manner I mean, will be quite clear to the reader, who must soon perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished. The two first books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are not of such completion as to warrant their passing the press; nor should they if I thought a year's castigation would do them any good; -- it will not: the foundations are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should die away: a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope that while it is dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit to live.\nThis may be speaking too presumptuously, and may deserve a punishment: but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it: he will leave me alone, with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object. This is not written with the least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course, but from the desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to look, and who do look with a zealous eye, to the honor of English literature.\nI hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology of Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I wish to try once more, before I bid it farewell.\nTeignmouth, April 10, 1818.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Endymion:-Book-I"}
{"title": "Endymion: Book II", "author": "John Keats", "text": "O Sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!\nAll records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,\nAnd shadowy, through the mist of passed years:\nFor others, good or bad, hatred and tears\nHave become indolent; but touching thine,\nOne sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,\nOne kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.\nThe woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,\nStiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,\nStruggling, and blood, and shrieks--all dimly fades\nInto some backward corner of the brain;\nYet, in our very souls, we feel amain\nThe close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.\nHence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!\nSwart planet in the universe of deeds!\nWide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds\nAlong the pebbled shore of memory!\nMany old rotten-timber'd boats there be\nUpon thy vaporous bosom, magnified\nTo goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,\nAnd golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.\nBut wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly\nAbout the great Athenian admiral's mast?\nWhat care, though striding Alexander past\nThe Indus with his Macedonian numbers?\nThough old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers\nThe glutted Cyclops, what care?--Juliet leaning\nAmid her window-flowers,--sighing,\u2014weaning\nTenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,\nDoth more avail than these: the silver flow\nOf Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,\nAre things to brood on with more ardency\nThan the death-day of empires. Fearfully\nMust such conviction come upon his head,\nWho, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,\nWithout one muse's smile, or kind behest,\nThe path of love and poesy. But rest,\nIn chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear\nThan to be crush'd, in striving to uprear\nLove's standard on the battlements of song.\nSo once more days and nights aid me along,\nLike legion'd soldiers.\nBrain-sick shepherd-prince,\nWhat promise hast thou faithful guarded since\nThe day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows\nCome with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?\nAlas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,\nHas he been wandering in uncertain ways:\nThrough wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;\nCounting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes\nOf the lone woodcutter; and listening still,\nHour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.\nNow he is sitting by a shady spring,\nAnd elbow-deep with feverous fingering\nStems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree\nPavilions him in bloom, and he doth see\nA bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now\nHe plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!\nIt swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;\nAnd, in the middle, there is softly pight\nA golden butterfly; upon whose wings\nThere must be surely character'd strange things,\nFor with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.\nLightly this little herald flew aloft,\nOnward it flies. From languor's sullen bands\nHis limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies\nDazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.\nIt seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;\nAnd like a new-born spirit did he pass\nThrough the green evening quiet in the sun,\nO'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,\nThrough buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams\nThe summer time away. One track unseams\nA wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue\nOf ocean fades upon him; then, anew,\nHe sinks adown a solitary glen,\nWhere there was never sound of mortal men,\nSaving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences\nMelting to silence, when upon the breeze\nSome holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,\nTo cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet\nWent swift beneath the merry-winged guide,\nUntil it reached a splashing fountain's side\nThat, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd\nUnto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,\nAnd, downward, suddenly began to dip,\nAs if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip\nThe crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch\nMost delicate, as though afraid to smutch\nEven with mealy gold the waters clear.\nBut, at that very touch, to disappear\nSo fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,\nEndymion sought around, and shook each bed\nOf covert flowers in vain; and then he flung\nHimself along the grass. What gentle tongue,\nWhat whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?\nIt was a nymph uprisen to the breast\nIn the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood\n'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.\nTo him her dripping hand she softly kist,\nAnd anxiously began to plait and twist\nHer ringlets round her fingers, saying: \"Youth!\nToo long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,\nThe bitterness of love: too long indeed,\nSeeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed\nThy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer\nAll the bright riches of my crystal coffer\nTo Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,\nGolden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,\nVermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;\nYea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws\nA virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands\nTawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands\nBy my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,\nMy charming rod, my potent river spells;\nYes, every thing, even to the pearly cup\nMeander gave me,\u2014for I bubbled up\nTo fainting creatures in a desert wild.\nBut woe is me, I am but as a child\nTo gladden thee; and all I dare to say,\nIs, that I pity thee; that on this day\nI've been thy guide; that thou must wander far\nIn other regions, past the scanty bar\nTo mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en\nFrom every wasting sigh, from every pain,\nInto the gentle bosom of thy love.\nWhy it is thus, one knows in heaven above:\nBut, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!\nI have a ditty for my hollow cell.\"\nHereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,\nWho brooded o'er the water in amaze:\nThe dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool\nLay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,\nQuick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,\nAnd fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill\nHad fallen out that hour. The wanderer,\nHolding his forehead, to keep off the burr\nOf smothering fancies, patiently sat down;\nAnd, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown\nGlow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,\nThus breath'd he to himself: \"Whoso encamps\nTo take a fancied city of delight,\nO what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,\nAfter long toil and travelling, to miss\nThe kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:\nYet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;\nAnother city doth he set about,\nFree from the smallest pebble-bead of doubt\nThat he will seize on trickling honey-combs:\nAlas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,\nAnd onward to another city speeds.\nBut this is human life: the war, the deeds,\nThe disappointment, the anxiety,\nImagination's struggles, far and nigh,\nAll human; bearing in themselves this good,\nThat they are sill the air, the subtle food,\nTo make us feel existence, and to shew\nHow quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,\nWhether to weeds or flowers; but for me,\nThere is no depth to strike in: I can see\nNought earthly worth my compassing; so stand\nUpon a misty, jutting head of land\u2014\nAlone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,\nWhen mad Eurydice is listening to 't;\nI'd rather stand upon this misty peak,\nWith not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,\nBut the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,\nThan be\u2014I care not what. O meekest dove\nOf heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!\nFrom thy blue throne, now filling all the air,\nGlance but one little beam of temper'd light\nInto my bosom, that the dreadful might\nAnd tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!\nYet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,\nWould give a pang to jealous misery,\nWorse than the torment's self: but rather tie\nLarge wings upon my shoulders, and point out\nMy love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout\nOf Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,\nToo keen in beauty, for thy silver prow\nNot to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.\nO be propitious, nor severely deem\nMy madness impious; for, by all the stars\nThat tend thy bidding, I do think the bars\nThat kept my spirit in are burst\u2014that I\nAm sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!\nHow beautiful thou art! The world how deep!\nHow tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep\nAround their axle! Then these gleaming reins,\nHow lithe! When this thy chariot attains\nIs airy goal, haply some bower veils\nThose twilight eyes? Those eyes!\u2014my spirit fails\u2014\nAnd lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;\nLike old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,\nOr blind Orion hungry for the morn.\nAnd, but from the deep cavern there was borne\nA voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;\nNor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan\nHad more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: \"Descend,\nYoung mountaineer! descend where alleys bend\nInto the sparry hollows of the world!\nOft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd\nAs from thy threshold, day by day hast been\nA little lower than the chilly sheen\nOf icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms\nInto the deadening ether that still charms\nTheir marble being: now, as deep profound\nAs those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd\nWhere airy voices lead: so through the hollow,\nThe silent mysteries of earth, descend!\"\nHe heard but the last words, nor could contend\nOne moment in reflection: for he fled\nInto the fearful deep, to hide his head\nFrom the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.\n'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;\nSharpening, by degrees, his appetite\nTo dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,\nThe region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,\nBut mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;\nA dusky empire and its diadems;\nOne faint eternal eventide of gems.\nAye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,\nAlong whose track the prince quick footsteps told,\nWith all its lines abrupt and angular:\nOut-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,\nThrough a vast antre; then the metal woof,\nLike Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof\nCurves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,\nIt seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss\nFancy into belief: anon it leads\nThrough winding passages, where sameness breeds\nVexing conceptions of some sudden change;\nWhether to silver grots, or giant range\nOf sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge\nAthwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge\nNow fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath\nTowers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth\nA hundred waterfalls, whose voices come\nBut as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb\nHis bosom grew, when first he, far away,\nDescried an orbed diamond, set to fray\nOld darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun\nUprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun\nCame the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,\nHe saw not fiercer wonders\u2014past the wit\nOf any spirit to tell, but one of those\nWho, when this planet's sphering time doth close,\nWill be its high remembrancers: who they?\nThe mighty ones who have made eternal day\nFor Greece and England. While astonishment\nWith deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went\nInto a marble gallery, passing through\nA mimic temple, so complete and true\nIn sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd\nTo search it inwards, whence far off appear'd,\nThrough a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,\nAnd, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,\nA quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,\nThe youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye\nDown sidelong aisles, and into niches old.\nAnd when, more near against the marble cold\nHe had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread\nAll courts and passages, where silence dead\nRous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:\nAnd long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint\nHimself with every mystery, and awe;\nTill, weary, he sat down before the maw\nOf a wide outlet, fathomless and dim\nTo wild uncertainty and shadows grim.\nThere, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,\nAnd thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore\nThe journey homeward to habitual self!\nA mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,\nWhose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,\nCheats us into a swamp, into a fire,\nInto the bosom of a hated thing.\nWhat misery most drowningly doth sing\nIn lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught\nThe goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,\nThe deadly feel of solitude: for lo!\nHe cannot see the heavens, nor the flow\nOf rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild\nIn pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,\nThe cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,\nLike herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest\nCool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;\nBut far from such companionship to wear\nAn unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,\nWas now his lot. And must he patient stay,\nTracing fantastic figures with his spear?\n\"No!\" exclaimed he, \"why should I tarry here?\"\nNo! loudly echoed times innumerable.\nAt which he straightway started, and 'gan tell\nHis paces back into the temple's chief;\nWarming and glowing strong in the belief\nHe caught her airy form, thus did he plain,\nMoving more near the while. \"O Haunter chaste\nOf river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,\nWhere with thy silver bow and arrows keen\nArt thou now forested? O woodland Queen,\nWhat smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?\nWhere dost thou listen to the wide halloos\nOf thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree\nGlimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,\n'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste\nFreedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste\nThy loveliness in dismal elements;\nBut, finding in our green earth sweet contents,\nThere livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee\nIt feels Elysian, how rich to me,\nAn exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!\nWithin my breast there lives a choking flame\u2014\nO let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!\nA homeward fever parches up my tongue\u2014\nO let me slake it at the running springs!\nUpon my ear a noisy nothing rings\u2014\nO let me once more hear the linnet's note!\nBefore mine eyes thick films and shadows float\u2014\nO let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!\nDost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?\nO think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!\nDost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?\nO think how this dry palate would rejoice!\nIf in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,\nOh think how I should love a bed of flowers!\u2014\nYoung goddess! let me see my native bowers!\nDeliver me from this rapacious deep!\"\nThus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap\nHis destiny, alert he stood: but when\nObstinate silence came heavily again,\nFeeling about for its old couch of space\nAnd airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face\nDesponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.\nBut 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill\nTo its old channel, or a swollen tide\nTo margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,\nAnd flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns\nUp heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns\nItself, and strives its own delights to hide\u2014\nNor in one spot alone; the floral pride\nIn a long whispering birth enchanted grew\nBefore his footsteps; as when heav'd anew\nOld ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,\nDown whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,\nBursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.\nIncreasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,\nUpon his fairy journey on he hastes;\nSo anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes\nOne moment with his hand among the sweets:\nOnward he goes\u2014he stops\u2014his bosom beats\nAs plainly in his ear, as the faint charm\nOf which the throbs were born. This still alarm,\nThis sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:\nFor it came more softly than the east could blow\nArion's magic to the Atlantic isles;\nOr than the west, made jealous by the smiles\nOf thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre\nTo seas Ionian and Tyrian.\nO did he ever live, that lonely man,\nWho lov'd\u2014and music slew not? 'Tis the pest\nOf love, that fairest joys give most unrest;\nThat things of delicate and tenderest worth\nAre swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,\nBy one consuming flame: it doth immerse\nAnd suffocate true blessings in a curse.\nHalf-happy, by comparison of bliss,\nIs miserable. 'Twas even so with this\nDew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;\nFirst heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,\nVanish'd in elemental passion.\nAnd down some swart abysm he had gone,\nHad not a heavenly guide benignant led\nTo where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head\nBrushing, awakened: then the sounds again\nWent noiseless as a passing noontide rain\nOver a bower, where little space he stood;\nFor as the sunset peeps into a wood\nSo saw he panting light, and towards it went\nThrough winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!\nUpon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,\nCupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.\nAfter a thousand mazes overgone,\nAt last, with sudden step, he came upon\nA chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,\nFull of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,\nAnd more of beautiful and strange beside:\nFor on a silken couch of rosy pride,\nIn midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth\nOf fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,\nThan sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:\nAnd coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,\nOr ripe October's faded marigolds,\nFell sleek about him in a thousand folds\u2014\nNot hiding up an Apollonian curve\nOf neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve\nOf knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;\nBut rather, giving them to the filled sight\nOfficiously. Sideway his face repos'd\nOn one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,\nBy tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth\nTo slumbery pout; just as the morning south\nDisparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,\nFour lily stalks did their white honours wed\nTo make a coronal; and round him grew\nAll tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,\nTogether intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:\nThe vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,\nShading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,\nOf velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;\nConvolvulus in streaked vases flush;\nThe creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;\nAnd virgin's bower, trailing airily;\nWith others of the sisterhood. Hard by,\nStood serene Cupids watching silently.\nOne, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,\nMuffling to death the pathos with his wings;\nAnd, ever and anon, uprose to look\nAt the youth's slumber; while another took\nA willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,\nAnd shook it on his hair; another flew\nIn through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise\nRain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.\nAt these enchantments, and yet many more,\nThe breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;\nUntil, impatient in embarrassment,\nHe forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went\nTo that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,\nSmiling, thus whisper'd: \"Though from upper day\nThou art a wanderer, and thy presence here\nMight seem unholy, be of happy cheer!\nFor 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,\nWhen some ethereal and high-favouring donor\nPresents immortal bowers to mortal sense;\nAs now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence\nWas I in no wise startled. So recline\nUpon these living flowers. Here is wine,\nAlive with sparkles\u2014never, I aver,\nSince Ariadne was a vintager,\nSo cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,\nSent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears\nWere high about Pomona: here is cream,\nDeepening to richness from a snowy gleam;\nSweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd\nFor the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd\nBy any touch, a bunch of blooming plums\nReady to melt between an infant's gums:\nAnd here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,\nIn starlight, by the three Hesperides.\nFeast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know\nOf all these things around us.\" He did so,\nStill brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;\nAnd thus: \"I need not any hearing tire\nBy telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd\nFor a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind\nHim all in all unto her doting self.\nWho would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,\nHe was content to let her amorous plea\nFaint through his careless arms; content to see\nAn unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;\nContent, O fool! to make a cold retreat,\nWhen on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,\nLay sorrowing; when every tear was born\nOf diverse passion; when her lips and eyes\nWere clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs\nCame vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.\nHush! no exclaim\u2014yet, justly mightst thou call\nCurses upon his head.\u2014I was half glad,\nBut my poor mistress went distract and mad,\nWhen the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew\nTo Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew\nImmortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;\nWhereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd\nEach summer time to life. Lo! this is he,\nThat same Adonis, safe in the privacy\nOf this still region all his winter-sleep.\nAye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep\nOver his waned corse, the tremulous shower\nHeal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,\nMedicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:\nThe which she fills with visions, and doth dress\nIn all this quiet luxury; and hath set\nUs young immortals, without any let,\nTo watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,\nEven to a moment's filling up, and fast\nShe scuds with summer breezes, to pant through\nThe first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew\nEmbower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.\nLook! how those winged listeners all this while\nStand anxious: see! behold!\"\u2014This clamant word\nBroke through the careful silence; for they heard\nA rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd\nPigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,\nThe while one hand, that erst upon his thigh\nLay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually\nUp to his forehead. Then there was a hum\nOf sudden voices, echoing, \"Come! come!\nArise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd\nUnto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd\nFull soothingly to every nested finch:\nRise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch\nTo your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!\"\nAt this, from every side they hurried in,\nRubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,\nAnd doubling overhead their little fists\nIn backward yawns. But all were soon alive:\nFor as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive\nIn nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,\nSo from the arbour roof down swell'd an air\nOdorous and enlivening; making all\nTo laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call\nFor their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green\nDisparted, and far upward could be seen\nBlue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,\nWhose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,\nSpun off a drizzling dew,\u2014which falling chill\nOn soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still\nNestle and turn uneasily about.\nSoon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,\nAnd silken traces lighten'd in descent;\nAnd soon, returning from love's banishment,\nQueen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:\nHer shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd\nA tumult to his heart, and a new life\nInto his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,\nBut for her comforting! unhappy sight,\nOf these first minutes? The unchariest muse\nTo embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.\nO it has ruffled every spirit there,\nSaving love's self, who stands superb to share\nThe general gladness: awfully he stands;\nA sovereign quell is in his waving hands;\nNo sight can bear the lightning of his bow;\nHis quiver is mysterious, none can know\nWhat themselves think of it; from forth his eyes\nThere darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:\nA scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who\nLook full upon it feel anon the blue\nOf his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.\nEndymion feels it, and no more controls\nThe burning prayer within him; so, bent low,\nHe had begun a plaining of his woe.\nBut Venus, bending forward, said: \"My child,\nFavour this gentle youth; his days are wild\nWith love\u2014he\u2014but alas! too well I see\nThou know'st the deepness of his misery.\nAh, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,\nThat when through heavy hours I used to rue\nThe endless sleep of this new-born Adon',\nThis stranger ay I pitied. For upon\nA dreary morning once I fled away\nInto the breezy clouds, to weep and pray\nFor this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd\nMe even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,\nDown-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,\nI saw this youth as he despairing stood:\nThose same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind:\nThose same full fringed lids a constant blind\nOver his sullen eyes: I saw him throw\nHimself on wither'd leaves, even as though\nDeath had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,\nYet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd\nSome fair immortal, and that his embrace\nHad zoned her through the night. There is no trace\nOf this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,\nAnd find it is the vainest thing to seek;\nAnd that of all things 'tis kept secretest.\nEndymion! one day thou wilt be blest:\nSo still obey the guiding hand that fends\nThee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.\n'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;\nAnd if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam\nThou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!\nHere must we leave thee.\"\u2014At these words up flew\nThe impatient doves, up rose the floating car,\nUp went the hum celestial. High afar\nThe Latmian saw them minish into nought;\nAnd, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught\nA vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.\nWhen all was darkened, with Etnean throe\nThe earth clos'd\u2014gave a solitary moan\u2014\nAnd left him once again in twilight lone.\nHe did not rave, he did not stare aghast,\nFor all those visions were o'ergone, and past,\nAnd he in loneliness: he felt assur'd\nOf happy times, when all he had endur'd\nWould seem a feather to the mighty prize.\nSo, with unusual gladness, on he hies\nThrough caves, and palaces of mottled ore,\nGold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,\nBlack polish'd porticos of awful shade,\nAnd, at the last, a diamond balustrade,\nLeading afar past wild magnificence,\nSpiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence\nStretching across a void, then guiding o'er\nEnormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,\nStreams subterranean tease their granite beds;\nThen heighten'd just above the silvery heads\nOf a thousand fountains, so that he could dash\nThe waters with his spear; but at the splash,\nDone heedlessly, those spouting columns rose\nSudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose\nHis diamond path with fretwork, streaming round\nAlive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,\nHaply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells\nWelcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells\nOn this delight; for, every minute's space,\nThe streams with changed magic interlace:\nSometimes like delicatest lattices,\nCover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,\nMoving about as in a gentle wind,\nWhich, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,\nPour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,\nSpangled, and rich with liquid broideries\nOf flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.\nSwifter than lightning went these wonders rare;\nAnd then the water, into stubborn streams\nCollecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,\nPillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,\nOf those dusk places in times far aloof\nCathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel\nTo these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,\nAnd torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,\nHalf seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,\nBlackening on every side, and overhead\nA vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread\nWith starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,\nThe solitary felt a hurried change\nWorking within him into something dreary,\u2014\nVex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,\nAnd purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.\nBut he revives at once: for who beholds\nNew sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?\nForth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,\nCame mother Cybele! alone\u2014alone\u2014\nIn sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown\nAbout her majesty, and front death-pale,\nWith turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale\nThe sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,\nTheir surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws\nUplifted drowsily, and nervy tails\nCowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails\nThis shadowy queen athwart, and faints away\nIn another gloomy arch.\nWherefore delay,\nYoung traveller, in such a mournful place?\nArt thou wayworn, or canst not further trace\nThe diamond path? And does it indeed end\nAbrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend\nThy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne\nCall ardently! He was indeed wayworn;\nAbrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;\nTo cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost\nTowards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,\nWithout one impious word, himself he flings,\nCommitted to the darkness and the gloom:\nDown, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,\nSwift as a fathoming plummet down he fell\nThrough unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,\nAnd rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,\nCame swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd\nSo thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd\nLarge honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd\nWith airs delicious. In the greenest nook\nThe eagle landed him, and farewel took.\nIt was a jasmine bower, all bestrown\nWith golden moss. His every sense had grown\nEthereal for pleasure; 'bove his head\nFlew a delight half-graspable; his tread\nWas Hesper\u00e8an; to his capable ears\nSilence was music from the holy spheres;\nA dewy luxury was in his eyes;\nThe little flowers felt his pleasant sighs\nAnd stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell\nHe wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell\nOf sudden exaltation: but, \"Alas!\nSaid he, \"will all this gush of feeling pass\nAway in solitude? And must they wane,\nLike melodies upon a sandy plain,\nWithout an echo? Then shall I be left\nSo sad, so melancholy, so bereft!\nYet still I feel immortal! O my love,\nMy breath of life, where art thou? High above,\nDancing before the morning gates of heaven?\nOr keeping watch among those starry seven,\nOld Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,\nOne of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?\nOr art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,\nWeaving a coronal of tender scions\nFor very idleness? Where'er thou art,\nMethinks it now is at my will to start\nInto thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,\nAnd snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main\nTo scud like a wild bird, and take thee off\nFrom thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff\nThy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.\nNo, no, too eagerly my soul deceives\nIts powerless self: I know this cannot be.\nO let me then by some sweet dreaming flee\nTo her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!\nHither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil\nFor some few hours the coming solitude.\"\nThus spake he, and that moment felt endued\nWith power to dream deliciously; so wound\nThrough a dim passage, searching till he found\nThe smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where\nHe threw himself, and just into the air\nStretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!\nA naked waist: \"Fair Cupid, whence is this?\"\nA well-known voice sigh'd, \"Sweetest, here am I!\"\nAt which soft ravishment, with doating cry\nThey trembled to each other.\u2014Helicon!\nO fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!\nThat thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er\nThese sorry pages; then the verse would soar\nAnd sing above this gentle pair, like lark\nOver his nested young: but all is dark\nAround thine aged top, and thy clear fount\nExhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count\nOf mighty Poets is made up; the scroll\nIs folded by the Muses; the bright roll\nIs in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes\nHave seen a new tinge in the western skies:\nThe world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,\nAlthough the sun of poesy is set,\nThese lovers did embrace, and we must weep\nThat there is no old power left to steep\nA quill immortal in their joyous tears.\nLong time in silence did their anxious fears\nQuestion that thus it was; long time they lay\nFondling and kissing every doubt away;\nLong time ere soft caressing sobs began\nTo mellow into words, and then there ran\nTwo bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.\n\"O known Unknown! from whom my being sips\nSuch darling essence, wherefore may I not\nBe ever in these arms? in this sweet spot\nPillow my chin for ever? ever press\nThese toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?\nWhy not for ever and for ever feel\nThat breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal\nAway from me again, indeed, indeed\u2014\nThou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed\nMy lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!\nIs\u2014is it to be so? No! Who will dare\nTo pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,\nFull well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still\nLet me entwine thee surer, surer\u2014now\nHow can we part? Elysium! who art thou?\nWho, that thou canst not be for ever here,\nOr lift me with thee to some starry sphere?\nEnchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,\nBy the most soft completion of thy face,\nThose lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,\nAnd by these tenderest, milky sovereignties\u2014\nThese tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,\nThe passion\"\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\"O lov'd Ida the divine!\nEndymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!\nHis soul will 'scape us\u2014O felicity!\nHow he does love me! His poor temples beat\nTo the very tune of love\u2014how sweet, sweet, sweet.\nRevive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;\nRevive, or these soft hours will hurry by\nIn tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell\nAffright this lethargy! I cannot quell\nIts heavy pressure, and will press at least\nMy lips to thine, that they may richly feast\nUntil we taste the life of love again.\nWhat! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!\nI love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;\nAnd so long absence from thee doth bereave\nMy soul of any rest: yet must I hence:\nYet, can I not to starry eminence\nUplift thee; nor for very shame can own\nMyself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan\nOr thou wilt force me from this secrecy,\nAnd I must blush in heaven. O that I\nHad done it already; that the dreadful smiles\nAt my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,\nHad waned from Olympus' solemn height,\nAnd from all serious Gods; that our delight\nWas quite forgotten, save of us alone!\nAnd wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone\nFor endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:\nYet must I be a coward!\u2014Horror rushes\nToo palpable before me\u2014the sad look\nOf Jove\u2014Minerva's start\u2014no bosom shook\nWith awe of purity\u2014no Cupid pinion\nIn reverence veiled\u2014my crystaline dominion\nHalf lost, and all old hymns made nullity!\nBut what is this to love? O I could fly\nWith thee into the ken of heavenly powers,\nSo thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,\nPress me so sweetly. Now I swear at once\nThat I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce\u2014\nPerhaps her love like mine is but unknown\u2014\nO I do think that I have been alone\nIn chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,\nWhile every eve saw me my hair uptying\nWith fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,\nI was as vague as solitary dove,\nNor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss\u2014\nAye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,\nAn immortality of passion's thine:\nEre long I will exalt thee to the shine\nOf heaven ambrosial; and we will shade\nOurselves whole summers by a river glade;\nAnd I will tell thee stories of the sky,\nAnd breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.\nMy happy love will overwing all bounds!\nO let me melt into thee; let the sounds\nOf our close voices marry at their birth;\nLet us entwine hoveringly\u2014O dearth\nOf human words! roughness of mortal speech!\nLispings empyrean will I sometime teach\nThine honied tongue\u2014lute-breathings, which I gasp\nTo have thee understand, now while I clasp\nThee thus, and weep for fondness\u2014I am pain'd,\nEndymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd\nIn the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?\"\u2014\nHereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife\nMelted into a languor. He return'd\nEntranced vows and tears.\nYe who have yearn'd\nWith too much passion, will here stay and pity,\nFor the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty\nNot of these days, but long ago 'twas told\nBy a cavern wind unto a forest old;\nAnd then the forest told it in a dream\nTo a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam\nA poet caught as he was journeying\nTo Phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling\nHis weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,\nAnd after, straight in that inspired place\nHe sang the story up into the air,\nGiving it universal freedom. There\nHas it been ever sounding for those ears\nWhose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers\nYon centinel stars; and he who listens to it\nMust surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:\nFor quenchless burnings come upon the heart,\nMade fiercer by a fear lest any part\nShould be engulphed in the eddying wind.\nAs much as here is penn'd doth always find\nA resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;\nAnon the strange voice is upon the wane\u2014\nAnd 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,\nThat the fair visitant at last unwound\nHer gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.\u2014\nThus the tradition of the gusty deep.\nNow turn we to our former chroniclers.\u2014\nEndymion awoke, that grief of hers\nSweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd\nHow lone he was once more, and sadly press'd\nHis empty arms together, hung his head,\nAnd most forlorn upon that widow'd bed\nSat silently. Love's madness he had known:\nOften with more than tortured lion's groan\nMoanings had burst from him; but now that rage\nHad pass'd away: no longer did he wage\nA rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.\nNo, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:\nThe lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd\nForgot all violence, and but commun'd\nWith melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd\nDrunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love\nHenceforth was dove-like.\u2014Loth was he to move\nFrom the imprinted couch, and when he did,\n'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid\nIn muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd\nHalf seeing visions that might have dismay'd\nAlecto's serpents; ravishments more keen\nThan Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean\nOver eclipsing eyes: and at the last\nIt was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,\nO'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,\nAnd crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,\nOf every shape and size, even to the bulk\nIn which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk\nAgainst an endless storm. Moreover too,\nFish-semblances, of green and azure hue,\nReady to snort their streams. In this cool wonder\nEndymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder\nOn all his life: his youth, up to the day\nWhen 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,\nHe stept upon his shepherd throne: the look\nOf his white palace in wild forest nook,\nAnd all the revels he had lorded there:\nEach tender maiden whom he once thought fair,\nWith every friend and fellow-woodlander\u2014\nPass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur\nOf the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans\nTo nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:\nThat wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:\nHis sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,\nUntil into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:\nThen all its buried magic, till it flush'd\nHigh with excessive love. \"And now,\" thought he,\n\"How long must I remain in jeopardy\nOf blank amazements that amaze no more?\nNow I have tasted her sweet soul to the core\nAll other depths are shallow: essences,\nOnce spiritual, are like muddy lees,\nMeant but to fertilize my earthly root,\nAnd make my branches lift a golden fruit\nInto the bloom of heaven: other light,\nThough it be quick and sharp enough to blight\nThe Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,\nDark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!\nMy silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;\nOr they are but the ghosts, the dying swells\nOf noises far away?\u2014list!\"\u2014Hereupon\nHe kept an anxious ear. The humming tone\nCame louder, and behold, there as he lay,\nOn either side outgush'd, with misty spray,\nA copious spring; and both together dash'd\nSwift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd\nAmong the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,\nLeaving a trickling dew. At last they shot\nDown from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise\nAs of some breathless racers whose hopes poize\nUpon the last few steps, and with spent force\nAlong the ground they took a winding course.\nEver pursued, the other strove to shun\u2014\nHe had left thinking of the mystery,\u2014\nAnd was now rapt in tender hoverings\nOver the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings\nHis dream away? What melodies are these?\nThey sound as through the whispering of trees,\nNot native in such barren vaults. Give ear!\n\"O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear\nSuch tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,\nWhy didst thou hear her prayer? O that I\nWere rippling round her dainty fairness now,\nCircling about her waist, and striving how\nTo entice her to a dive! then stealing in\nBetween her luscious lips and eyelids thin.\nO that her shining hair was in the sun,\nAnd I distilling from it thence to run\nIn amorous rillets down her shrinking form!\nTo linger on her lily shoulders, warm\nBetween her kissing breasts, and every charm\nTouch raptur'd!\u2014See how painfully I flow:\nFair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.\nStay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,\nA happy wooer, to the flowery mead\nWhere all that beauty snar'd me.\"\u2014\"Cruel god,\nDesist! or my offended mistress' nod\nWill stagnate all thy fountains:\u2014tease me not\nWith syren words\u2014Ah, have I really got\nSuch power to madden thee? And is it true\u2014\nAway, away, or I shall dearly rue\nMy very thoughts: in mercy then away,\nKindest Alpheus for should I obey\nMy own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane.\"\u2014\n\"O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain\nLike this of mine, then would I fearless turn\nAnd be a criminal.\"\u2014\"Alas, I burn,\nI shudder\u2014gentle river, get thee hence.\nAlpheus! thou enchanter! every sense\nOf mine was once made perfect in these woods.\nFresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,\nRipe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;\nBut ever since I heedlessly did lave\nIn thy deceitful stream, a panting glow\nGrew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,\nAnd call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.\nNot once more did I close my happy eyes\nAmid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!\nO 'twas a cruel thing.\"\u2014\"Now thou dost taunt\nSo softly, Arethusa, that I think\nIf thou wast playing on my shady brink,\nThou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!\nStifle thine heart no more;\u2014nor be afraid\nOf angry powers: there are deities\nWill shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs\n'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour\nA dewy balm upon them!\u2014fear no more,\nSweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel\nSometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal\nBlushing into my soul, and let us fly\nThese dreary caverns for the open sky.\nI will delight thee all my winding course,\nFrom the green sea up to my hidden source\nAbout Arcadian forests; and will shew\nThe channels where my coolest waters flow\nThrough mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,\nI roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen\nThan Saturn in his exile; where I brim\nRound flowery islands, and take thence a skim\nOf mealy sweets, which myriads of bees\nBuzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please\nThyself to choose the richest, where we might\nBe incense-pillow'd every summer night.\nDoff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,\nAnd let us be thus comforted; unless\nThou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream\nHurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,\nAnd pour to death along some hungry sands.\"\u2014\n\"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands\nSevere before me: persecuting fate!\nUnhappy Arethusa! thou wast late\nA huntress free in\"\u2014At this, sudden fell\nThose two sad streams adown a fearful dell.\nThe Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,\nSave echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er\nThe name of Arethusa. On the verge\nOf that dark gulph he wept, and said: \"I urge\nThee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,\nBy our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,\nIf thou art powerful, these lovers pains;\nAnd make them happy in some happy plains.\nHe turn'd\u2014there was a whelming sound\u2014he stept,\nThere was a cooler light; and so he kept\nTowards it by a sandy path, and lo!\nMore suddenly than doth a moment go,\nThe visions of the earth were gone and fled\u2014\nHe saw the giant sea above his head.\n(line 168): For the three occasions which Endymion had seen Diana, refer to the account given to Peona; beginning with line 540, Book I, -- to the passage about the well, line 896, Book I, -- and to the passage in which he hurried into the grotto, line 971, Book I.\n(line 430): In the draft, Endymion was described as The mortal Latmian.\n(line 676) Hesper\u00e8an, I presume, not Hesp\u00e8rean as invariably accented by Milton. The precise value of 'capable' as used here is of course regulated by past and not by present custom. In this case it simply stands for receptive, able to receive, as in Hamlet (Act III, Scene IV).\n(lines 689-92) Endymion conjectures whether his unknown love is one of the Hours, or one of the nymph Pleione's daughters by Atlas, transferred to heaven as the Pleiades.\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

{"title": "Endymion: Book III", "author": "John Keats", "text": "There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men\nWith most prevailing tinsel: who unpen\nTheir baaing vanities, to browse away\nThe comfortable green and juicy hay\nFrom human pastures; or, O torturing fact!\nWho, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd\nFire-branded foxes to sear up and singe\nOur gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge\nOf sanctuary splendour, not a sight\nAble to face an owl's, they still are dight\nBy the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,\nAnd crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,\nSave of blown self-applause, they proudly mount\nTo their spirit's perch, their being's high account,\nTheir tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones\u2014\nAmid the fierce intoxicating tones\nOf trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,\nAnd sudden cannon. Ah! how all this hums,\nIn wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone\u2014\nLike thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,\nAnd set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.\u2014\nAre then regalities all gilded masks?\nNo, there are throned seats unscalable\nBut by a patient wing, a constant spell,\nOr by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,\nCan make a ladder of the eternal wind,\nAnd poise about in cloudy thunder-tents\nTo watch the abysm-birth of elements.\nAye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate\nA thousand Powers keep religious state,\nIn water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;\nAnd, silent as a consecrated urn,\nHold sphery sessions for a season due.\nYet few of these far majesties, ah, few!\nHave bared their operations to this globe\u2014\nFew, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe\nOur piece of heaven\u2014whose benevolence\nShakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense\nFilling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,\nAs bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud\n'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,\nEterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair\nIs of all these the gentlier-mightiest.\nWhen thy gold breath is misting in the west,\nShe unobserved steals unto her throne,\nAnd there she sits most meek and most alone;\nAs if she had not pomp subservient;\nAs if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent\nTowards her with the Muses in thine heart;\nAs if the ministring stars kept not apart,\nWaiting for silver-footed messages.\nO Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees\nFeel palpitations when thou lookest in:\nO Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din\nThe while they feel thine airy fellowship.\nThou dost bless every where, with silver lip\nKissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,\nCouched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:\nInnumerable mountains rise, and rise,\nAmbitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;\nAnd yet thy benediction passeth not\nOne obscure hiding-place, one little spot\nWhere pleasure may be sent: the nested wren\nHas thy fair face within its tranquil ken,\nAnd from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf\nTakes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief\nTo the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps\nWithin its pearly house.\u2014The mighty deeps,\nThe monstrous sea is thine\u2014the myriad sea!\nO Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,\nAnd Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.\nCynthia! where art thou now? What far abode\nOf green or silvery bower doth enshrine\nSuch utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine\nFor one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale\nFor one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail\nHis tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?\nAh! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,\nOr what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!\nHow chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!\nShe dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness\nIs wan on Neptune's blue: yet there's a stress\nOf love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,\nDancing upon the waves, as if to please\nThe curly foam with amorous influence.\nO, not so idle: for down-glancing thence\nShe fathoms eddies, and runs wild about\nO'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out\nThe thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning\nTheir savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.\nWhere will the splendor be content to reach?\nO love! how potent hast thou been to teach\nStrange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,\nIn gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,\nIn light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,\nThou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won.\nAmid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;\nThou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;\nThou madest Pluto bear thin element;\nAnd now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent\nA moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,\nTo find Endymion.\nOn gold sand impearl'd\nWith lily shells, and pebbles milky white,\nPoor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light\nAgainst his pallid face: he felt the charm\nTo breathlessness, and suddenly a warm\nOf his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd\nHis wandering steps, and half-entranced laid\nHis head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,\nTo taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,\nLashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.\nAnd so he kept, until the rosy veils\nMantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand\nWere lifted from the water's breast, and fann'd\nInto sweet air; and sober'd morning came\nMeekly through billows:\u2014when like taper-flame\nLeft sudden by a dallying breath of air,\nHe rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare\nAlong his fated way.\nFar had he roam'd,\nWith nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd\nAbove, around, and at his feet; save things\nMore dead than Morpheus' imaginings:\nOld rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large\nOf gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;\nRudders that for a hundred years had lost\nThe sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd\nWith long-forgotten story, and wherein\nNo reveller had ever dipp'd a chin\nBut those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,\nWrit in the tongue of heaven, by those souls\nWho first were on the earth; and sculptures rude\nIn ponderous stone, developing the mood\nOf ancient Nox;\u2014then skeletons of man,\nOf beast, behemoth, and leviathan,\nAnd elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw\nOf nameless monster. A cold leaden awe\nThese secrets struck into him; and unless\nDian had chaced away that heaviness,\nHe might have died: but now, with cheered feel,\nHe onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal\nAbout the labyrinth in his soul of love.\n\"What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move\nMy heart so potently? When yet a child\nI oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.\nThou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went\nFrom eve to morn across the firmament.\nNo apples would I gather from the tree,\nTill thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:\nNo tumbling water ever spake romance,\nBut when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:\nNo woods were green enough, no bower divine,\nUntil thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:\nIn sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,\nOr drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;\nAnd, in the summer tide of blossoming,\nNo one but thee hath heard me blithly sing\nAnd mesh my dewy flowers all the night.\nNo melody was like a passing spright\nIf it went not to solemnize thy reign.\nYes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain\nBy thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;\nAnd as I grew in years, still didst thou blend\nWith all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;\nThou wast the mountain-top\u2014the sage's pen\u2014\nThe poet's harp\u2014the voice of friends\u2014the sun;\nThou wast the river\u2014thou wast glory won;\nThou wast my clarion's blast\u2014thou wast my steed\u2014\nMy goblet full of wine\u2014my topmost deed:\u2014\nThou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!\nO what a wild and harmonized tune\nMy spirit struck from all the beautiful!\nOn some bright essence could I lean, and lull\nMyself to immortality: I prest\nNature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.\nBut, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss\u2014\nMy strange love came\u2014Felicity's abyss!\nShe came, and thou didst fade, and fade away\u2014\nYet not entirely; no, thy starry sway\nHas been an under-passion to this hour.\nNow I begin to feel thine orby power\nIs coming fresh upon me: O be kind,\nKeep back thine influence, and do not blind\nMy sovereign vision.\u2014Dearest love, forgive\nThat I can think away from thee and live!\u2014\nPardon me, airy planet, that I prize\nOne thought beyond thine argent luxuries!\nHow far beyond!\" At this a surpris'd start\nFrosted the springing verdure of his heart;\nFor as he lifted up his eyes to swear\nHow his own goddess was past all things fair,\nHe saw far in the concave green of the sea\nAn old man sitting calm and peacefully.\nUpon a weeded rock this old man sat,\nAnd his white hair was awful, and a mat\nOf weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;\nAnd, ample as the largest winding-sheet,\nA cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,\nO'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans\nOf ambitious magic: every ocean-form\nWas woven in with black distinctness; storm,\nAnd calm, and whispering, and hideous roar\nWere emblem'd in the woof; with every shape\nThat skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.\nThe gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,\nYet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell\nTo its huge self; and the minutest fish\nWould pass the very hardest gazer's wish,\nAnd show his little eye's anatomy.\nThen there was pictur'd the regality\nOf Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,\nIn beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.\nBeside this old man lay a pearly wand,\nAnd in his lap a book, the which he conn'd\nSo stedfastly, that the new denizen\nHad time to keep him in amazed ken,\nTo mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.\nThe old man rais'd his hoary head and saw\nThe wilder'd stranger\u2014seeming not to see,\nHis features were so lifeless. Suddenly\nHe woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows\nWent arching up, and like two magic ploughs\nFurrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,\nWhich kept as fixedly as rocky marge,\nTill round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.\nThen up he rose, like one whose tedious toil\nHad watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,\nWho had not from mid-life to utmost age\nEas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,\nEven to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,\nWith convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,\nAnd in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd\nEcho into oblivion, he said:\u2014\n\"Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head\nIn peace upon my watery pillow: now\nSleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.\nO Jove! I shall be young again, be young!\nO shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung\nWith new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,\nWhen I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?\u2014\nI'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen\nTheir melodies, and see their long hair glisten;\nAnon upon that giant's arm I'll be,\nThat writhes about the roots of Sicily:\nTo northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,\nAnd mount upon the snortings of a whale\nTo some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep\nOn forked lightning, to the deepest deep,\nWhere through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd\nWith rapture to the other side of the world!\nO, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,\nI bow full hearted to your old decree!\nYes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,\nFor I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.\nThou art the man!\" Endymion started back\nDismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack\nTortures hot breath, and speech of agony,\nMutter'd: \"What lonely death am I to die\nIn this cold region? Will he let me freeze,\nAnd float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?\nOr will he touch me with his searing hand,\nAnd leave a black memorial on the sand?\nOr tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,\nAnd keep me as a chosen food to draw\nHis magian fish through hated fire and flame?\nO misery of hell! resistless, tame,\nAm I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,\nUntil the gods through heaven's blue look out!\u2014\nO Tartarus! but some few days agone\nHer soft arms were entwining me, and on\nHer voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:\nHer lips were all my own, and\u2014ah, ripe sheaves\nOf happiness! ye on the stubble droop,\nBut never may be garner'd. I must stoop\nMy head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!\nIs there no hope from thee? This horrid spell\nWould melt at thy sweet breath.\u2014By Dian's hind\nFeeding from her white fingers, on the wind\nI see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,\nI care not for this old mysterious man!\"\nHe spake, and walking to that aged form,\nLook'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm\nWith pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.\nHad he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?\nHad he, though blindly contumelious, brought\nRheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,\nConvulsion to a mouth of many years?\nHe had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.\nThe penitent shower fell, as down he knelt\nBefore that care-worn sage, who trembling felt\nAbout his large dark locks, and faultering spake:\n\"Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus' sake!\nI know thine inmost bosom, and I feel\nA very brother's yearning for thee steal\nInto mine own: for why? thou openest\nThe prison gates that have so long opprest\nMy weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,\nThou art commission'd to this fated spot\nFor great enfranchisement. O weep no more;\nI am a friend to love, to loves of yore:\nAye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power\nI had been grieving at this joyous hour\nBut even now most miserable old,\nI saw thee, and my blood no longer cold\nGave mighty pulses: in this tottering case\nGrew a new heart, which at this moment plays\nAs dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,\nFor thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,\nNow as we speed towards our joyous task.\"\nSo saying, this young soul in age's mask\nWent forward with the Carian side by side:\nResuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide\nHung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands\nTook silently their foot-prints. \"My soul stands\nNow past the midway from mortality,\nAnd so I can prepare without a sigh\nTo tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.\nI was a fisher once, upon this main,\nAnd my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;\nRough billows were my home by night and day,\u2014\nThe sea-gulls not more constant; for I had\nNo housing from the storm and tempests mad,\nBut hollow rocks,\u2014and they were palaces\nOf silent happiness, of slumberous ease:\nLong years of misery have told me so.\nAye, thus it was one thousand years ago.\nOne thousand years!\u2014Is it then possible\nTo look so plainly through them? to dispel\nA thousand years with backward glance sublime?\nTo breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime\nFrom off a crystal pool, to see its deep,\nAnd one's own image from the bottom peep?\nYes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,\nMy long captivity and moanings all\nAre but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,\nThe which I breathe away, and thronging come\nLike things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.\n\"I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:\nI was a lonely youth on desert shores.\nMy sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,\nAnd craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry\nPlaining discrepant between sea and sky.\nDolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen\nWould let me feel their scales of gold and green,\nNor be my desolation; and, full oft,\nWhen a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft\nIts hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe\nTo burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe\nMy life away like a vast sponge of fate,\nSome friendly monster, pitying my sad state,\nHas dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,\nAnd left me tossing safely. But the crown\nOf all my life was utmost quietude:\nMore did I love to lie in cavern rude,\nKeeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,\nAnd if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!\nThere blush'd no summer eve but I would steer\nMy skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear\nThe shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,\nMingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:\nAnd never was a day of summer shine,\nBut I beheld its birth upon the brine:\nFor I would watch all night to see unfold\nHeaven's gates, and Aethon snort his morning gold\nWide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly\nAt brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,\nMy nets would be spread out, and I at rest.\nThe poor folk of the sea-country I blest\nWith daily boon of fish most delicate:\nThey knew not whence this bounty, and elate\nWould strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.\n\"Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach\nAt things which, but for thee, O Latmian!\nHad been my dreary death? Fool! I began\nTo feel distemper'd longings: to desire\nThe utmost privilege that ocean's sire\nCould grant in benediction: to be free\nOf all his kingdom. Long in misery\nI wasted, ere in one extremest fit\nI plung'd for life or death. To interknit\nOne's senses with so dense a breathing stuff\nMight seem a work of pain; so not enough\nCan I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,\nAnd buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt\nWhole days and days in sheer astonishment;\nForgetful utterly of self-intent;\nMoving but with the mighty ebb and flow.\nThen, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew\nHis spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,\nI tried in fear the pinions of my will.\n'Twas freedom! and at once I visited\nThe ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.\nNo need to tell thee of them, for I see\nThat thou hast been a witness\u2014it must be\nFor these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,\nBy the melancholy corners of that mouth.\nSo I will in my story straightway pass\nTo more immediate matter. Woe, alas!\nThat love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!\nWhy did poor Glaucus ever\u2014ever dare\nTo sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!\nI lov'd her to the very white of truth,\nAnd she would not conceive it. Timid thing!\nShe fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,\nRound every isle, and point, and promontory,\nFrom where large Hercules wound up his story\nFar as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew\nThe more, the more I saw her dainty hue\nGleam delicately through the azure clear:\nUntil 'twas too fierce agony to bear;\nAnd in that agony, across my grief\nIt flash'd, that Circe might find some relief\u2014\nCruel enchantress! So above the water\nI rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter.\nAeaea's isle was wondering at the moon:\u2014\nIt seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon\nLeft me dead-drifting to that fatal power.\n\"When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;\nJust when the light of morn, with hum of bees,\nStole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.\nHow sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,\nAnd over it a sighing voice expire.\nIt ceased\u2014I caught light footsteps; and anon\nThe fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon\nPush'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!\nWith tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove\nA net whose thraldom was more bliss than all\nThe range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall\nThe dew of her rich speech: \"Ah! Art awake?\nO let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!\nI am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed\nAn urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;\nAnd now I find thee living, I will pour\nUntil exhausted of the latest drop,\nSo it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop\nHere, that I too may live: but if beyond\nSuch cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond\nOf soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;\nIf thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;\nIf smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,\nHang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,\nO let me pluck it for thee.\" Thus she link'd\nHer charming syllables, till indistinct\nTheir music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;\nAnd then she hover'd over me, and stole\nSo near, that if no nearer it had been\nThis furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.\n\"Young man of Latmos! thus particular\nAm I, that thou may'st plainly see how far\nThis fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not\nExclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?\n\"Who could resist? Who in this universe?\nShe did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse\nMy fine existence in a golden clime.\nShe took me like a child of suckling time,\nAnd cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,\nThe current of my former life was stemm'd,\nAnd to this arbitrary queen of sense\nI bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence\nHave mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd\nMe back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.\nFor as Apollo each eve doth devise\nA new appareling for western skies;\nSo every eve, nay every spendthrift hour\nShed balmy consciousness within that bower.\nAnd I was free of haunts umbrageous;\nCould wander in the mazy forest-house\nOf squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,\nAnd birds from coverts innermost and drear\nWarbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow\u2014\nTo me new born delights!\n\"Now let me borrow,\nFor moments few, a temperament as stern\nAs Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn\nThese uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell\nHow specious heaven was changed to real hell.\n\"One morn she left me sleeping: half awake\nI sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake\nMy greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;\nBut she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts\nOf disappointment stuck in me so sore,\nThat out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.\nWandering about in pine and cedar gloom\nDamp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom\nA sound of moan, an agony of sound,\nSepulchral from the distance all around.\nThen came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled\nThat fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled\nDown a precipitous path, as if impell'd.\nI came to a dark valley.\u2014Groanings swell'd\nPoisonous about my ears, and louder grew,\nThe nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,\nThat glar'd before me through a thorny brake.\nThis fire, like the eye of gordian snake,\nBewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near\nA sight too fearful for the feel of fear:\nIn thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene\u2014\nThe banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,\nSeated upon an uptorn forest root;\nAnd all around her shapes, wizard and brute,\nLaughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,\nShewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!\nO such deformities! Old Charon's self,\nShould he give up awhile his penny pelf,\nAnd take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,\nIt could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,\nAnd tyrannizing was the lady's look,\nAs over them a gnarled staff she shook.\nOft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,\nAnd from a basket emptied to the rout\nClusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick\nAnd roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick\nAbout their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,\nAnon she took a branch of mistletoe,\nAnd emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:\nGroan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial\nWas sharpening for their pitiable bones.\nShe lifted up the charm: appealing groans\nFrom their poor breasts went sueing to her ear\nIn vain; remorseless as an infant's bier\nShe whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.\nWhereat was heard a noise of painful toil,\nIncreasing gradual to a tempest rage,\nShrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;\nUntil their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat\nAnd puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:\nThen was appalling silence: then a sight\nMore wildering than all that hoarse affright;\nFor the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,\nWent through the dismal air like one huge Python\nAntagonizing Boreas,\u2014and so vanish'd.\nYet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd\nThese phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark\nCame waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,\nWith dancing and loud revelry,\u2014and went\nSwifter than centaurs after rapine bent.\u2014\nSighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd\nBefore the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud\nIn human accent: \"Potent goddess! chief\nOf pains resistless! make my being brief,\nOr let me from this heavy prison fly:\nOr give me to the air, or let me die!\nI sue not for my happy crown again;\nI sue not for my phalanx on the plain;\nI sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;\nI sue not for my ruddy drops of life,\nMy children fair, my lovely girls and boys!\nI will forget them; I will pass these joys;\nAsk nought so heavenward, so too\u2014too high:\nOnly I pray, as fairest boon, to die,\nOr be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,\nFrom this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,\nAnd merely given to the cold bleak air.\nHave mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!\"\nThat curst magician's name fell icy numb\nUpon my wild conjecturing: truth had come\nNaked and sabre-like against my heart.\nI saw a fury whetting a death-dart;\nAnd my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,\nFainted away in that dark lair of night.\nThink, my deliverer, how desolate\nMy waking must have been! disgust, and hate,\nAnd terrors manifold divided me\nA spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee\nInto the dungeon core of that wild wood:\nI fled three days\u2014when lo! before me stood\nGlaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,\nA clammy dew is beading on my brow,\nAt mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.\n\"Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse\nMade of rose leaves and thistledown, express,\nTo cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,\nI am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:\nMy tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.\nSo, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies\nUnheard of yet; and it shall still its cries\nUpon some breast more lily-feminine.\nOh, no\u2014it shall not pine, and pine, and pine\nMore than one pretty, trifling thousand years;\nAnd then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears\nCut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!\nYoung dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt\nOne hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,\nThat our heart-broken parting is so nigh.\nAnd must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.\nYet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,\nLet me sob over thee my last adieus,\nAnd speak a blessing: Mark me! thou hast thews\nImmortal, for thou art of heavenly race:\nBut such a love is mine, that here I chase\nEternally away from thee all bloom\nOf youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.\nHence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;\nAnd there, ere many days be overpast,\nDisabled age shall seize thee; and even then\nThou shalt not go the way of aged men;\nBut live and wither, cripple and still breathe\nTen hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath\nThy fragile bones to unknown burial.\nAdieu, sweet love, adieu!\"\u2014As shot stars fall,\nShe fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung\nAnd poisoned was my spirit: despair sung\nA war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.\nA hand was at my shoulder to compel\nMy sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes\nMoved on with pointed finger. In this guise\nEnforced, at the last by ocean's foam\nI found me; by my fresh, my native home.\nIts tempering coolness, to my life akin,\nCame salutary as I waded in;\nAnd, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave\nBattle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave\nLarge froth before me, while there yet remain'd\nHale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.\n\"Young lover, I must weep\u2014such hellish spite\nWith dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might\nProving upon this element, dismay'd,\nUpon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;\nI look'd\u2014'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!\nO vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?\nCould not thy harshest vengeance be content,\nBut thou must nip this tender innocent\nBecause I lov'd her?\u2014Cold, O cold indeed\nWere her fair limbs, and like a common weed\nThe sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was\nI clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass\nFleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,\nUntil there shone a fabric crystalline,\nRibb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.\nHeadlong I darted; at one eager swirl\nGain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!\n'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;\nAnd all around\u2014But wherefore this to thee\nWho in few minutes more thyself shalt see?\u2014\nI left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.\nMy fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread\nMet palsy half way: soon these limbs became\nGaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.\n\"Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,\nWithout one hope, without one faintest trace\nOf mitigation, or redeeming bubble\nOf colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble\nThy brain to loss of reason: and next tell\nHow a restoring chance came down to quell\nOne half of the witch in me.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  On a day,\nSitting upon a rock above the spray,\nI saw grow up from the horizon's brink\nA gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink\nAway from me again, as though her course\nHad been resum'd in spite of hindering force\u2014\nSo vanish'd: and not long, before arose\nDark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.\nOld Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,\nBut could not: therefore all the billows green\nToss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.\nThe tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds\nIn perilous bustle; while upon the deck\nStood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;\nThe final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:\nI heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.\nO they had all been sav'd but crazed eld\nAnnull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd\nAnd curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit\nWrithing with pity, and a cursing fit\nAgainst that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,\nBy one and one, to pale oblivion;\nAnd I was gazing on the surges prone,\nWith many a scalding tear and many a groan,\nWhen at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,\nGrasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.\nI knelt with pain\u2014reached out my hand\u2014had grasp'd\nThese treasures\u2014touch'd the knuckles\u2014they unclasp'd\u2014\nI caught a finger: but the downward weight\nO'erpowered me\u2014it sank. Then 'gan abate\nThe storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst\nThe comfortable sun. I was athirst\nTo search the book, and in the warming air\nParted its dripping leaves with eager care.\nStrange matters did it treat of, and drew on\nMy soul page after page, till well-nigh won\nInto forgetfulness; when, stupefied,\nI read these words, and read again, and tried\nMy eyes against the heavens, and read again.\nO what a load of misery and pain\nEach Atlas-line bore off!\u2014a shine of hope\nCame gold around me, cheering me to cope\nStrenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!\nFor thou hast brought their promise to an end.\n\"In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,\nDoom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch\nHis loath'd existence through ten centuries,\nAnd then to die alone. Who can devise\nA total opposition? No one. So\nOne million times ocean must ebb and flow,\nAnd he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,\nThese things accomplish'd:\u2014If he utterly\nScans all the depths of magic, and expounds\nThe meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;\nIf he explores all forms and substances\nStraight homeward to their symbol-essences;\nHe shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,\nHe must pursue this task of joy and grief\nMost piously;\u2014all lovers tempest-tost,\nAnd in the savage overwhelming lost,\nHe shall deposit side by side, until\nTime's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:\nWhich done, and all these labours ripened,\nA youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,\nShall stand before him; whom he shall direct\nHow to consummate all. The youth elect\nMust do the thing, or both will be destroy'd.\"\u2014\n\"Then,\" cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,\n\"We are twin brothers in this destiny!\nSay, I intreat thee, what achievement high\nIs, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.\nWhat! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,\nHad we both perish'd?\"\u2014\"Look!\" the sage replied,\n\"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,\nOf divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice\nI told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;\nAnd where I have enshrined piously\nAll lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die\nThroughout my bondage.\" Thus discoursing, on\nThey went till unobscur'd the porches shone;\nWhich hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.\nSure never since king Neptune held his state\nWas seen such wonder underneath the stars.\nTurn to some level plain where haughty Mars\nHas legion'd all his battle; and behold\nHow every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold\nHis even breast: see, many steeled squares,\nAnd rigid ranks of iron\u2014whence who dares\nOne step? Imagine further, line by line,\nThese warrior thousands on the field supine:\u2014\nSo in that crystal place, in silent rows,\nPoor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.\u2014\nThe stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd\nSuch thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;\nSuch ranges of white feet, and patient lips\nAll ruddy,\u2014for here death no blossom nips.\nHe mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair\nPut sleekly on one side with nicest care;\nAnd each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,\nPut cross-wise to its heart.\n\"Let us commence,\nWhisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now.\"\nHe spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,\nBegan to tear his scroll in pieces small,\nUttering the while some mumblings funeral.\nHe tore it into pieces small as snow\nThat drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;\nAnd having done it, took his dark blue cloak\nAnd bound it round Endymion: then struck\nHis wand against the empty air times nine.\u2014\n\"What more there is to do, young man, is thine:\nBut first a little patience; first undo\nThis tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.\nAh, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;\nAnd shouldst thou break it\u2014What, is it done so clean?\nA power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!\nThe spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.\nHere is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,\nNor mark'd with any sign or charactery\u2014\nCanst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!\nOlympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break\nThis wand against yon lyre on the pedestal.\"\n'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall\nSweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd\nA lullaby to silence.\u2014\"Youth! now strew\nThese minced leaves on me, and passing through\nThose files of dead, scatter the same around,\nAnd thou wilt see the issue.\"\u2014'Mid the sound\nOf flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,\nEndymion from Glaucus stood apart,\nAnd scatter'd in his face some fragments light.\nHow lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight\nSmiling beneath a coral diadem,\nOut-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,\nAppear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,\nKneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force\nPress'd its cold hand, and wept\u2014and Scylla sigh'd!\nEndymion, with quick hand, the charm applied\u2014\nThe nymph arose: he left them to their joy,\nAnd onward went upon his high employ,\nShowering those powerful fragments on the dead.\nAnd, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,\nAs doth a flower at Apollo's touch.\nDeath felt it to his inwards; 'twas too much:\nDeath fell a weeping in his charnel-house.\nThe Latmian persever'd along, and thus\nAll were re-animated. There arose\nA noise of harmony, pulses and throes\nOf gladness in the air\u2014while many, who\nHad died in mutual arms devout and true,\nSprang to each other madly; and the rest\nFelt a high certainty of being blest.\nThey gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment\nGrew drunken, and would have its head and bent.\nDelicious symphonies, like airy flowers,\nBudded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers\nOf light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.\nThe two deliverers tasted a pure wine\nOf happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.\nSpeechless they eyed each other, and about\nThe fair assembly wander'd to and fro,\nDistracted with the richest overflow\nOf joy that ever pour'd from heaven.\n\u2014\u2014\"Away!\"\nOur piety to Neptunus supreme!\"\u2014\nThen Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,\nThey led on first, bent to her meek surprise,\nThrough portal columns of a giant size,\nInto the vaulted, boundless emerald.\nDown marble steps; pouring as easily\nAs hour-glass sand\u2014and fast, as you might see\nSwallows obeying the south summer's call,\nOr swans upon a gentle waterfall.\nThus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,\nEre from among some rocks of glittering spar,\nJust within ken, they saw descending thick\nAnother multitude. Whereat more quick\nMoved either host. On a wide sand they met,\nAnd of those numbers every eye was wet;\nFor each their old love found. A murmuring rose,\nLike what was never heard in all the throes\nOf wind and waters: 'tis past human wit\nTo tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.\nThis mighty consummation made, the host\nMov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost\nHuge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,\nAnd from the rear diminishing away,\u2014\nTill a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,\n\"Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!\nGod Neptune's palaces!\" With noise increas'd,\nThey shoulder'd on towards that brightening east.\nAt every onward step proud domes arose\nIn prospect,\u2014diamond gleams, and golden glows\nOf amber 'gainst their faces levelling.\nJoyous, and many as the leaves in spring,\nStill onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.\nRich opal domes were seen, on high upheld\nBy jasper pillars, letting through their shafts\nA blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts\nEach gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:\nFor what poor mortals fragment up, as mere\nAs marble was there lavish, to the vast\nOf one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,\nEven for common bulk, those olden three,\nMemphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.\nAs large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow\nOf Iris, when unfading it doth shew\nBeyond a silvery shower, was the arch\nThrough which this Paphian army took its march,\nInto the outer courts of Neptune's state:\nWhence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,\nTo which the leaders sped; but not half raught\nEre it burst open swift as fairy thought,\nAnd made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes\nLike callow eagles at the first sunrise.\nSoon with an eagle nativeness their gaze\nRipe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,\nAnd then, behold! large Neptune on his throne\nOf emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;\nAt his right hand stood winged Love, and on\nHis left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.\nFar as the mariner on highest mast\nCan see all round upon the calmed vast,\nSo wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue\nDoth vault the waters, so the waters drew\nTheir doming curtains, high, magnificent,\nAw'd from the throne aloof;\u2014and when storm-rent\nDisclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;\nBut sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,\nNoiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering\nDeath to a human eye: for there did spring\nFrom natural west, and east, and south, and north,\nA light as of four sunsets, blazing forth\nA gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.\nOf lucid depth the floor, and far outspread\nAs breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe\nOf feather'd Indian darts about, as through\nThe delicatest air: air verily,\nBut for the portraiture of clouds and sky:\nThis palace floor breath-air,\u2014but for the amaze\nOf deep-seen wonders motionless,\u2014and blaze\nOf the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,\nGlobing a golden sphere.\nThey stood in dreams\nTill Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;\nThe Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;\nAnd the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.\nThen Love took wing, and from his pinions shed\nOn all the multitude a nectarous dew.\nThe ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew\nFair Scylla and her guides to conference;\nAnd when they reach'd the throned eminence\nShe kist the sea-nymph's cheek,\u2014who sat her down\nA toying with the doves. Then,\u2014\"Mighty crown\nAnd sceptre of this kingdom!\" Venus said,\n\"Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:\nBehold!\"\u2014Two copious tear-drops instant fell\nFrom the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,\nAnd over Glaucus held his blessing hands.\u2014\n\"Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands\nOf love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour\nI met thee in earth's bosom, all my power\nHave I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet\nEscap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?\nA little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,\nOr I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,\nA humid eye, and steps luxurious,\nWhere these are new and strange, are ominous.\nAye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,\nWhen others were all blind; and were I given\nTo utter secrets, haply I might say\nSome pleasant words:\u2014but Love will have his day.\nSo wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,\nEven in the passing of thine honey-moon,\nVisit my Cytherea: thou wilt find\nCupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;\nAnd pray persuade with thee\u2014Ah, I have done,\nAll blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!\"\u2014\nThus the fair goddess: while Endymion\nKnelt to receive those accents halcyon.\nMeantime a glorious revelry began\nBefore the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran\nIn courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;\nAnd plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd\nNew growth about each shell and pendent lyre;\nThe which, in disentangling for their fire,\nPull'd down fresh foliage and coverture\nFor dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,\nFlutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng\nMade a delighted way. Then dance, and song,\nAnd garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.\nIn harmless tendril they each other chain'd,\nAnd strove who should be smother'd deepest in\nFresh crush of leaves.\nO 'tis a very sin\nFor one so weak to venture his poor verse\nIn such a place as this. O do not curse,\nHigh Muses! let him hurry to the ending.\nAll suddenly were silent. A soft blending\nOf dulcet instruments came charmingly;\nAnd then a hymn.\n\"KING of the stormy sea!\nBrother of Jove, and co-inheritor\nOf elements! Eternally before\nThee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,\nAt thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock\nIts deep foundations, hissing into foam.\nAll mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home\nOf thy capacious bosom ever flow.\nThou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe\nSkulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint\nOf all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint\nWhen, from thy diadem, a silver gleam\nSlants over blue dominion. Thy bright team\nGulphs in the morning light, and scuds along\nTo bring thee nearer to that golden song\nApollo singeth, while his chariot\nWaits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not\nFor scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;\nAnd it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,\nAs newly come of heaven, dost thou sit\nTo blend and interknit\nSubdued majesty with this glad time.\nO shell-borne King sublime!\nWe lay our hearts before thee evermore\u2014\nWe sing, and we adore!\n\"Breathe softly, flutes;\nBe tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;\nNor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;\nNot flowers budding in an April rain,\nNor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,\u2014\nNo, nor the Eolian twang of Love's own bow,\nCan mingle music fit for the soft ear\nOf goddess Cytherea!\nYet deign, white Queen of Beauty, thy fair eyes\nOn our souls' sacrifice.\n\"Bright-winged Child!\nWho has another care when thou hast smil'd?\nUnfortunates on earth, we see at last\nAll death-shadows, and glooms that overcast\nOur spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions.\nO sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!\nGod of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,\nAnd panting bosoms bare!\nDear unseen light in darkness! eclipser\nOf light in light! delicious poisoner!\nThy venom'd goblet will we quaff until\nWe fill\u2014we fill!\nAnd by thy Mother's lips\u2014\u2014\"\nWas heard no more\nFor clamour, when the golden palace door\nOpened again, and from without, in shone\nA new magnificence. On oozy throne\nSmooth-moving came Oceanus the old,\nTo take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,\nBefore he went into his quiet cave\nTo muse for ever\u2014Then a lucid wave,\nScoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,\nAfloat, and pillowing up the majesty\nOf Doris, and the Egean seer, her spouse\u2014\nNext, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,\nTheban Amphion leaning on his lute:\nHis fingers went across it\u2014All were mute\nTo gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,\nAnd Thetis pearly too.\u2014\nThe palace whirls\nAround giddy Endymion; seeing he\nWas there far strayed from mortality.\nHe could not bear it\u2014shut his eyes in vain;\nImagination gave a dizzier pain.\n\"O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!\nWhere is my lovely mistress? Well-away!\nI die\u2014I hear her voice\u2014I feel my wing\u2014\"\nAt Neptune's feet he sank. A sudden ring\nOf Nereids were about him, in kind strife\nTo usher back his spirit into life:\nBut still he slept. At last they interwove\nTheir cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey\nTowards a crystal bower far away.\nLo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,\nTo his inward senses these words spake aloud;\nWritten in star-light on the dark above:\nDearest Endymion! my entire love!\nHow have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done\u2014\nImmortal bliss for me too hast thou won.\nArise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch\nHer ready eggs, before I'll kissing snatch\nThee into endless heaven. Awake! awake!\nThe youth at once arose: a placid lake\nCame quiet to his eyes; and forest green,\nCooler than all the wonders he had seen,\nLull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast.\nHow happy once again in grassy nest!\n(line 1): Woodhouse notes that \"Keats said, with much simplicity, 'It will be easily seen what I think of the present ministers, by the beginning of the third Book.'\"\n(line 407): Whether the reference is to the Pillars of Hercules, the confluence of the Mediterranean and Atlantic, or to the scene of the Death of Hercules, is not very clear; but probably \"wound up his story\" refers rather to his last labour than to his death on Mount \u0152ta.\n(lines 863-65): This simile must surely be a reminiscence of Perrin's Fables Amusantes or some similar book used in Mr. Clarke's School. I remember the Fable of the old eagle and her young stood first in the book I used at school.

{"title": "Hyperion, A Vision: Attempted Reconstruction Of The Poem", "author": "John Keats", "text": "CANTO I.\nFanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave\nA paradise for a sect; the savage, too,\nFrom forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep\nGuesses at heaven; pity these have not\nTrac'd upon vellum or wild Indian leaf\nThe shadows of melodious utterance,\nBut bare of laurel they live, dream, and die;\nFor Poesy alone can tell her dreams,--\nWith the fine spell of words alone can save\nImagination from the sable chain\nAnd dumb enchantment. Who alive can say,\n\"Thou art no Poet -- may'st not tell thy dreams?\"\nSince every man whose soul is not a clod\nHath visions and would speak, if he had loved,\nAnd been well nurtured in his mother tongue.\nWhether the dream now purpos'd to rehearse\nBe poet's or fanatic's will be known\nWhen this warm scribe, my hand, is in the grave.\nMethought I stood where trees of every clime,\nPalm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech,\nWith plantane and spice-blossoms, made a screen,\nIn neighbourhood of fountains (by the noise\nSoft-showering in mine ears), and (by the touch\nOf scent) not far from roses. Twining round\nI saw an arbour with a drooping roof\nOf trellis vines, and bells, and larger blooms,\nLike floral censers, swinging light in air;\nBefore its wreathed doorway, on a mound\nOf moss, was spread a feast of summer fruits,\nWhich, nearer seen, seem'd refuse of a meal\nBy angel tasted or our Mother Eve;\nFor empty shells were scatter'd on the grass,\nAnd grapestalks but half-bare, and remnants more\nSweet-smelling, whose pure kinds I could not know.\nStill was more plenty than the fabled horn\nThrice emptied could pour forth at banqueting,\nFor Prosperine return'd to her own fields,\nWhere the white heifers low. And appetite,\nMore yearning than on earth I ever felt,\nGrowing within, I ate deliciously,--\nAnd, after not long, thirsted; for thereby\nStood a cool vessel of transparent juice\nSipp'd by the wander'd bee, the which I took,\nAnd pledging all the mortals of the world,\nAnd all the dead whose names are in our lips,\nDrank. That full draught is parent of my theme.\nNo Asian poppy nor elixir fine\nOf the soon-fading, jealous, Caliphat,\nNo poison gender'd in close monkish cell,\nTo thin the scarlet conclave of old men,\nCould so have rapt unwilling life away.\nAmong the fragment husks and berries crush'd\nUpon the grass, I struggled hard against\nThe domineering potion, but in vain.\nThe cloudy swoon came on, and down I sank,\nLike a Silenus on an antique vase.\nHow long I slumber'd 'tis a chance to guess.\nWhen sense of life return'd, I started up\nAs if with wings, but the fair trees were gone,\nThe mossy mound and arbour were no more;\nI look'd around upon the curved sides\nOf an old sanctuary, with roof august,\nBuilded so high, it seem'd that filmed clouds\nMight spread beneath as o'er the stars of heaven.\nSo old the place was, I remember'd none\nThe like upon the earth: what I had seen\nOf grey cathedrals, buttress'd walls, rent towers,\nThe superannuations of sunk realms,\nOr Nature's rocks toil'd hard in waves and winds,\nSeem'd but the faulture of decrepit things\nTo that eternal domed monument.\nUpon the marble at my feet there lay\nWhich needs have been of dyed asbestos wove,\nOr in that place the moth could not corrupt,\nSo white the linen, so, in some, distinct\nRan imageries from a sombre loom.\nAll in a mingled heap confus'd there lay\nRobes, golden tongs, censer and chafing-dish,\nGirdles, and chains, and holy jewelries.\nTurning from these with awe, once more I raised\nMy eyes to fathom the space every way:\nThe embossed roof, the silent massy range\nOf columns north and south, ending in mist\nOf nothing; then to eastward, where black gates\nWere shut against the sunrise evermore;\nThen to the west I look'd, and saw far off\nAn image, huge of feature as a cloud,\nAt level of whose feet an altar slept,\nTo be approach'd on either side by steps\nAnd marble balustrade, and patient travail\nTo count with toil the innumerable degrees.\nTowards the altar sober-pac'd I went,\nRepressing haste as too unholy there;\nAnd, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine\nOne ministering; and there arose a flame\nWhen in mid-day the sickening east-wind\nShifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain\nMelts out of the frozen incense from all flowers,\nAnd fills the air with so much pleasant health\nThat even the dying man forgets his shroud;--\nEven so that lofty sacrificial fire,\nSending forth Maian incense, spread around\nForgetfulness of everything but bliss,\nAnd clouded all the altar with soft smoke;\nFrom whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard\nLanguage pronounc'd: \"If thou canst not ascend\nThese steps, die on that marble where thou art.\nThy flesh, near cousin to the common dust,\nWill parch for lack of nutriment; thy bones\nWill wither in few years, and vanish so\nThat not the quickest eye could find a grain\nOf what thou now art on that pavement cold.\nThe sands of thy short life are spent this hour,\nAnd no hand in the universe can turn\nThy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt\nEre thou canst mount up these immortal steps.\"\nI heard, I look'd: two senses both at once,\nSo fine, so subtle, felt the tyranny\nOf that fierce threat and the hard task proposed.\nProdigious seem'd the toil; the leaves were yet\nBurning, when suddenly a palsied chill\nStruck from the paved level up my limbs.\nAnd was ascending quick to put cold grasp\nUpon those streams that pulse beside the throat.\nI shriek'd, and the sharp anguish of my shriek\nStung my own ears; I strove hard to escape\nThe numbness, strove to gain the lowest step.\nSlow, heavy, deadly was my pace: the cold\nGrew stifling, suffocating at the heart;\nAnd when I clasp'd my hands I felt them not.\nOne minute before death my ic'd foot touch'd\nThe lowest stair; and, as it touch'd, life seem'd\nTo pour in at the toes; I mounted up\nAs once fair angels on a ladder flew\nFrom the green turf to heaven. \"Holy Power,\"\nCry'd I, approaching near the horned shrine,\n\"What am I that another death come not\nTo choke my utterance, sacrilegious, here?\"\nThen said the veiled shadow: \"Thou hast felt\nWhat 'tis to die and live again before\nThy fated hour; that thou hadst power to do so\nIs thine own safety; thou hast dated on\nThy doom.\" \"High Prophetess,\" said I, \"purge off,\nBenign, if so it please thee, my mind's film.\"\n\"None can usurp this height,\" return'd that shade,\n\"But those to whom the miseries of the world\nAre misery, and will not let them rest.\nAll else who find a haven in the world,\nWhere they may thoughtless sleep away their days,\nIf by a chance into this fane they come,\nRot on the pavement where thou rottedst half.\"\n\"Are there not thousands in the world,\" said I,\nEncourag'd by the sooth voice of the shade,\n\"Who love their fellows even to the death,\nWho feel the giant agony of the world,\nAnd more, like slaves to poor humanity,\nLabour for mortal good? I sure should see\nOther men here, but I am here alone.\"\n\"Those whom thou spakest of are no visionaries,\"\nRejoin'd that voice; \"they are no dreamers weak;\nThey seek no wonder but the human face,\nNo music but a happy-noted voice:\nThey come not here, they have no thought to come;\nAnd thou art here, for thou art less than they.\nWhat benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,\nTo the great world? Thou art a dreaming thing,\nA fever of thyself: think of the earth;\nWhat bliss, even in hope, is there for thee?\nWhat haven? every creature hath its home,\nEvery sole man hath days of joy and pain,\nWhether his labours be sublime or low --\nThe pain alone, the joy alone, distinct:\nOnly the dreamer venoms all his days,\nBearing more woe than all his sins deserve.\nTherefore, that happiness be somewhat shared,\nSuch things as thou art are admitted oft\nInto like gardens thou didst pass erewhile,\nAnd suffer'd in these temples: for that cause\nThou standest safe beneath this statue's knees.\"\n\"That I am favour'd for unworthiness,\nBut such propitious parley medicined\nIn sickness not ignoble, I rejoice,\nAye, and could weep for love of such award.\"\nSo answer'd I, continuing, \"If it please,\nMajestic shadow, tell me where I am,\nWhose altar this, for whom this incense curls;\nWhat image this whose face I cannot see\nFor the broad marble knees; and who thou art,\nOf accent feminine so courteous?\"\nThen the tall shade, in drooping linen veil'd,\nSpoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath\nStirr'd the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung\nAbout a golden censer from her hand\nPendent; and by her voice I knew she shed\nLong-treasured tears. \"This temple, sad and lone,\nIs all spar'd from the thunder of a war\nFoughten long since by giant hierarchy\nAgainst rebellion: this old image here,\nWhose carved features wrinkled as he fell,\nIs Saturn's; I, Moneta, left supreme,\nSole goddess of this desolation.\"\nI had no words to answer, for my tongue,\nUseless, could find about its roofed home\nNo syllable of a fit majesty\nTo make rejoinder of Moneta's mourn:\nThere was a silence, while the altar's blaze\nWas fainting for sweet food. I look'd thereon,\nAnd on the paved floor, where nigh were piled\nFaggots of cinnamon, and many heaps\nOf other crisped spicewood: then again\nI look'd upon the altar, and its horns\nWhiten'd with ashes, and its languorous flame,\nAnd then upon the offerings again;\nAnd so, by turns, till sad Moneta cry'd:\n\"The sacrifice is done, but not the less\nWill I be kind to thee for thy good will.\nMy power, which to me is still a curse,\nShall be to thee a wonder; for the scenes\nStill swooning vivid through my globbed brain,\nWith an electral changing misery,\nThou shalt with these dull mortal eyes behold\nFree from all pain, if wonder pain thee not.\"\nAs near as an immortal's sphered words\nCould to a mother's soften were these last:\nAnd yet I had a terror of her robes,\nAnd chiefly of the veils that from her brow\nHung pale, and curtain'd her in mysteries,\nThat made my heart too small to hold its blood.\nThis saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand\nParted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,\nNot pin'd by human sorrows, but bright-blanch'd\nBy an immortal sickness which kills not;\nIt works a constant change, which happy death\nCan put no end to; deathwards progressing\nTo no death was that visage; it had past\nThe lilly and the snow; and beyond these\nI must not think now, though I saw that face.\nBut for her eyes I should have fled away;\nThey held me back with a benignant light,\nSoft, mitigated by divinest lids\nHalf-clos'd, and visionless entire they seem'd\nOf all external things; they saw me not,\nBut in blank splendour beam'd, like the mild moon,\nWho comforts those she sees not, who knows not\nWhat eyes are upward cast. As I had found\nA grain of gold upon a mountain's side,\nAnd, twing'd with avarice, strain'd out my eyes\nTo search its sullen entrails rich with ore,\nSo, at the sad view of Moneta's brow,\nI ask'd to see what things the hollow brow\nBehind environ'd: what high tragedy\nIn the dark secret chambers of her skull\nWas acting, that could give so dread a stress\nTo her cold lips, and fill with such a light\nHer planetary eyes, and touch her voice\nWith such a sorrow? \"Shade of Memory!\"\nCried I, with act adorant at her feet,\n\"By all the gloom hung round thy fallen house,\nBy this last temple, by the golden age,\nBy Great Apollo, thy dear Foster-child,\nAnd by thyself, forlorn divinity,\nThe pale Omega of a wither'd race,\nLet me behold, according as thou saidst,\nWhat in thy brain so ferments to and fro!\"\nNo sooner had this conjuration past\nMy devout lips, than side by side we stood\n(Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine)\nDeep in the shady sadness of a vale\nFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\nFar from the fiery noon and eve's one star.\nOnward I look'd beneath the gloomy boughs,\nAnd saw what first I thought an image huge,\nLike to the image pedestall'd so high\nIn Saturn's temple; then Moneta's voice\nCame brief upon mine ear. \"So Saturn sat\nWhen he had lost his realms;\" whereon there grew\nA power within me of enormous ken\nTo see as a god sees, and take the depth\nOf things as nimbly as the outward eye\nCan size and shape pervade. The lofty theme\nOf those few words hung vast before my mind\nWith half-unravell'd web. I sat myself\nUpon an eagle's watch, that I might see,\nAnd seeing ne'er forget. No stir of life\nWas in this shrouded vale, -- not so much air\nAs in the zoning of a summer's day\nRobs not one light seed from the feather'd grass;\nBut where the dead leaf fell there did it rest.\nA stream went noiseless by, still deaden'd more\nBy reason of the fallen divinity\nSpreading more shade; the Naiad 'mid her reeds\nPrest her cold finger closer to her lips.\nAlong the margin-sand large foot-marks went\nNo further than to where old Saturn's feet\nHad rested, and there slept how long a sleep!\nDegraded, cold, upon the sodden ground\nHis old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,\nUnsceptred, and his realmless eyes were closed;\nWhile his bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth,\nHis ancient mother, for some comfort yet.\nIt seem'd no force could wake him from his place;\nBut there came one who, with a kindred hand,\nTouch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low\nWith reverence, though to one who knew it not.\nThen came the griev'd voice of Mnemosyne,\nAnd griev'd I hearken'd. \"That divinity\nWhom thou saw'st step from yon forlornest wood,\nAnd with slow pace approach our fallen king,\nIs Thea, softest-natured of our brood.\"\nI mark'd the Goddess, in fair statuary\nSurpassing wan Moneta by the head,\nAnd in her sorrow nearer woman's tears.\nThere was a list'ning fear in her regard,\nAs if calamity had but begun;\nAs if the venom'd clouds of evil days\nHad spent their malice, and the sullen rear\nOne hand she press'd upon that aching spot\nWhere beats the human heart, as if just there,\nThough an immortal, she felt cruel pain;\nThe other upon Saturn's bended neck\nShe laid, and to the level of his ear\nLeaning, with parted lips some words she spoke\nIn solemn tenour and deep organ-tone;\nSome mourning words, which in our feeble tongue\nWould come in this like accenting; how frail\nTo that large utterance of the early gods!\n\"Saturn, look up! and for what, poor lost king?\nI have no comfort for thee; no, not one;\nI cannot say, wherefore thus sleepest thou?\nFor Heaven is parted from thee, and the Earth\nKnows thee not, so afflicted, for a god.\nThe Ocean, too, with all its solemn noise,\nHas from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air\nIs emptied of thy hoary majesty.\nThy thunder, captious at the new command,\nRumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;\nAnd thy sharp lightning, in unpractis'd hands,\nScourges and burns our once serene domain.\n\"With such remorseless speed still come new woes,\nThat unbelief has not a space to breathe.\nSaturn! sleep on: me thoughtless, why should I\nThus violate thy slumbrous solitude?\nWhy should I ope thy melancholy eyes?\nSaturn! sleep on, while at thy feet I weep.\"\nAs when upon a tranced summer-night\nForests, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,\nDream, and so dream all night without a noise,\nSave from one gradual solitary gust\nSwelling upon the silence, dying off,\nAs if the ebbing air had but one wave,\nSo came these words and went; the while in tears\nShe prest her fair large forehead to the earth,\nJust where her fallen hair might spread in curls,\nA soft and silken net for Saturn's feet.\nLong, long these two were postured motionless,\nLike sculpture builded-up upon the grave\nOr their own power. A long awful time\nI look'd upon them: still they were the same;\nThe frozen God still bending to the earth,\nAnd the sad Goddess weeping at his feet;\nMoneta silent. Without stay or prop\nBut my own weak mortality, I bore\nThe load of this eternal quietude,\nThe unchanging gloom and the three fixed shapes\nPonderous upon my senses, a whole moon;\nFor by my burning brain I measured sure\nHer silver seasons shedded on the night.\nAnd every day by day methought I grew\nMore gaunt and ghostly. Oftentimes I pray'd\nIntense, that death would take me from the vale\nAnd all its burthens; gasping with despair\nOf change, hour after hour I curs'd myself,\nUntil old Saturn rais'd his faded eyes,\nAnd look'd around and saw his kingdom gone,\nAnd all the gloom and sorrow of the place,\nAnd that fair kneeling Goddess at his feet.\nAs the moist scent of flowers, and grass, and leaves,\nFills forest-dells with a pervading air,\nKnown to the woodland nostril, so the words\nOf Saturn fill'd the mossy glooms around,\nEven to the hollows of time-eaten oaks,\nAnd to the windings of the foxes' hole,\nWith sad, low tones, while thus he spoke, and sent\nStrange moanings to the solitary Pan.\n\"Moan, brethren, moan, for we are swallow'd up\nAnd buried from all godlike exercise\nOf influence benign on planets pale,\nAnd peaceful sway upon man's harvesting,\nAnd all those acts which Deity supreme\nDoth ease its heart of love in.\u00a0 Moan and wail;\nMoan, brethren, moan; for lo, the rebel spheres\nSpin round; the stars their ancient courses keep;\nClouds still with shadowy moisture haunt the earth,\nStill suck their fill of light from sun and moon;\nStill buds the tree, and still the seashores murmur;\nThere is no death in all the universe,\nNo smell of death. -- There shall be death.\u00a0 Moan, moan,\nMoan, Cybele, moan; for thy pernicious babes\nWeak as the reed, weak, feeble as my voice.\nOh! Oh! the pain, the pain of feebleness;\nThrow down those imps, and give me victory.\nLet me hear other groans, and trumpets blown\nOf triumph calm, and hymns of festival,\nFrom the gold peaks of heaven's high-piled clouds;\nVoices of soft proclaim, and silver stir\nOf strings in hollow shells; and there shall be\nBeautiful things made new, for the surprise\nOf the sky-children.\"\u00a0 So he feebly ceased,\nWith such a poor and sickly-sounding pause,\nMethought I heard some old man of the earth\nBewailing earthly loss; nor could my eyes\nAnd ears act with that unison of sense\nWhich marries sweet sound with the grace of form,\nAnd dolorous accent from a tragic harp\nWith large-limb'd visions.\u00a0 More I scrutinized.\nStill fixt he sat beneath the sable trees,\nWhose arms spread straggling in wild serpent forms\nWith leaves all hush'd; his awful presence there\n(Now all was silent) gave a deadly lie\nTo what I erewhile heard: only his lips\nTrembled amid the white curls of his beard;\nThey told the truth, though round the snowy locks\nHung nobly, as upon the face of heaven\nA mid-day fleece of clouds.\u00a0 Thea arose,\nAnd stretcht her white arm through the hollow dark,\nPointing some whither: whereat he too rose,\nLike a vast giant, seen by men at sea\nTo grow pale from the waves at dull midnight.\nThey melted from my sight into the woods;\nEre I could turn, Moneta cry'd, \"These twain\nAre speeding to the families of grief,\nWhere, rooft in by black rocks, they waste in pain\nAnd darkness, for no hope.\"\u00a0 And she spake on,\nAs ye may read who can unwearied pass\nOnward from the antechamber of this dream,\nWhere, even at the open doors, awhile\nI must delay, and glean my memory\nOf her high phrase -- perhaps no further dare.\nCANTO II.\n\"Mortal, that thou may'st understand aright,\nI humanize my sayings to thine ear,\nMaking comparisons of earthly things;\nOr thou might'st better listen to the wind,\nWhose language is to thee a barren noise,\nThough it blows legend-laden thro' the trees.\nIn melancholy realms big tears are shed,\nMore sorrow like to this, and such like woe,\nToo huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe.\nThe Titans fierce, self-hid or prison-bound,\nGroan for the old allegiance once more,\nListening in their doom for Saturn's voice.\nBut one of the whole eagle-brood still keeps\nHis sovereignty, and rule, and majesty:\nBlazing Hyperion on his orbed fire\nStill sits, still snuffs the incense teeming up\nFrom Man to the Sun's God -- yet insecure.\nFor as upon the earth dire prodigies\nFright and perplex, so also shudders he;\nNot at dog's howl or gloom-bird's hated screech,\nOr the familiar visiting of one\nUpon the first toll of his passing bell,\nOr prophesyings of the midnight lamp;\nBut horrors, portioned to a giant nerve,\nMake great Hyperion ache. His palace bright,\nBastion'd with pyramids of shining gold,\nAnd touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,\nGlares a blood-red thro' all the thousand courts,\nArches, and domes, and fiery galleries;\nAnd all its curtains of Aurorian clouds\nFlash angerly; when he would taste the wreaths\nOf incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,\nInstead of sweets, his ample palate takes\nSavour of poisonous brass and metals sick;\nWherefore when harbour'd in the sleepy West,\nAfter the full completion of fair day,\nFor rest divine upon exalted couch,\nAnd slumber in the arms of melody,\nHe paces through the pleasant hours of ease,\nWith strides colossal, on from hall to hall,\nWhile far within each aisle and deep recess\nHis winged minions in close clusters stand\nAmaz'd, and full of fear; like anxious men,\nWho on a wide plain gather in sad troops,\nWhen earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.\nEven now where Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,\nGoes step for step with Thea from yon woods,\nHyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,\nIs sloping to the threshold of the West.\nThither we tend.\"\u00a0 Now in the clear light I stood,\nReliev'd from the dusk vale.\u00a0 Mnemosyne\nWas sitting on a square-edg'd polish'd stone,\nThat in its lucid depth reflected pure\nHer priestess' garments.\u00a0 My quick eyes ran on\nFrom stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,\nThrough bow'rs of fragrant and enwreathed light,\nAnd diamond-paved lustrous long arcades.\nAnon rush'd by the bright Hyperion;\nHis flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,\nAnd gave a roar as if of earthy fire,\nThat scar'd away the meek ethereal hours,\nAnd made their dove-wings tremble.

O moments big as years!\nAll as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,\nAnd press it so upon our weary griefs\nThat unbelief has not a space to breathe.\nSaturn, sleep on:\u2014-O thoughtless, why did I\nThus violate thy slumbrous solitude?\nWhy should I ope thy melancholy eyes?\nSaturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.\"\nAs when, upon a tranced summer-night,\nThose green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,\nTall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,\nDream, and so dream all night without a stir,\nSave from one gradual solitary gust\nWhich comes upon the silence, and dies off,\nAs if the ebbing air had but one wave;\nSo came these words and went; the while in tears\nShe touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,\nJust where her fallen hair might be outspread\nA soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.\nOne moon, with alteration slow, had shed\nHer silver seasons four upon the night,\nAnd still these two were postured motionless,\nLike natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;\nThe frozen God still couchant on the earth,\nAnd the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:\nUntil at length old Saturn lifted up\nHis faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,\nAnd all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,\nAnd that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,\nAs with a palsied tongue, and while his beard\nShook horrid with such aspen-malady:\n\"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,\nThea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;\nLook up, and let me see our doom in it;\nLook up, and tell me if this feeble shape\nIs Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice\nOf Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,\nNaked and bare of its great diadem,\nPeers like the front of Saturn? Who had power\nTo make me desolate? Whence came the strength?\nHow was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,\nWhile Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?\nBut it is so; and I am smother'd up,\nAnd buried from all godlike exercise\nOf influence benign on planets pale,\nOf admonitions to the winds and seas,\nOf peaceful sway above man's harvesting,\nAnd all those acts which Deity supreme\nDoth ease its heart of love in.\u2014-I am gone\nAway from my own bosom: I have left\nMy strong identity, my real self,\nSomewhere between the throne, and where I sit\nHere on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!\nOpen thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round\nUpon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;\nSpace region'd with life-air; and barren void;\nSpaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.\u2014-\nSearch, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest\nA certain shape or shadow, making way\nWith wings or chariot fierce to repossess\nA heaven he lost erewhile: it must\u2014-it must\nBe of ripe progress\u2014-Saturn must be King.\nYes, there must be a golden victory;\nThere must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown\nOf triumph calm, and hymns of festival\nUpon the gold clouds metropolitan,\nVoices of soft proclaim, and silver stir\nOf strings in hollow shells; and there shall be\nBeautiful things made new, for the surprise\nOf the sky-children; I will give command:\nThea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?\"\nThis passion lifted him upon his feet,\nAnd made his hands to struggle in the air,\nHis Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,\nHis eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.\nHe stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;\nA little time, and then again he snatch'd\nUtterance thus.\u2014-\"But cannot I create?\nCannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth\nAnother world, another universe,\nTo overbear and crumble this to nought?\nWhere is another Chaos? Where?\"\u2014-That word\nFound way unto Olympus, and made quake\nThe rebel three.\u2014-Thea was startled up,\nAnd in her bearing was a sort of hope,\nAs thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.\n\"This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,\nO Saturn! come away, and give them heart;\nI know the covert, for thence came I hither.\"\nThus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went\nWith backward footing through the shade a space:\nThrough aged boughs, that yielded like the mist\nWhich eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.\nMeanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,\nMore sorrow like to this, and such like woe,\nToo huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:\nThe Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,\nGroan'd for the old allegiance once more,\nAnd listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.\nBut one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept\nHis sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;\u2014-\nBlazing Hyperion on his orbed fire\nStill sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up\nFrom man to the sun's God: yet unsecure:\nFor as among us mortals omens drear\nFright and perplex, so also shuddered he\u2014-\nNot at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,\nOr the familiar visiting of one\nUpon the first toll of his passing-bell,\nOr prophesyings of the midnight lamp;\nBut horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,\nOft made Hyperion ache.\u00a0 His palace bright,\nBastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,\nAnd touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,\nGlar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,\nArches, and domes, and fiery galleries;\nAnd all its curtains of Aurorian clouds\nFlush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings,\nUnseen before by Gods or wondering men,\nDarken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard\nNot heard before by Gods or wondering men.\nAlso, when he would taste the spicy wreaths\nOf incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,\nInstead of sweets, his ample palate took\nSavor of poisonous brass and metal sick:\nAnd so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,\nAfter the full completion of fair day,\u2014-\nFor rest divine upon exalted couch,\nAnd slumber in the arms of melody,\nHe pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease\nWith stride colossal, on from hall to hall;\nWhile far within each aisle and deep recess,\nHis winged minions in close clusters stood,\nAmaz'd and full offear; like anxious men\nWho on wide plains gather in panting troops,\nWhen earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.\nEven now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,\nWent step for step with Thea through the woods,\nHyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,\nCame slope upon the threshold of the west;\nThen, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope\nIn smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,\nBlown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet\nAnd wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;\nAnd like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,\nIn fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,\nThat inlet to severe magnificence\nStood full blown, for the God to enter in.\nHe enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;\nHis flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,\nAnd gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,\nThat scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours\nAnd made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared\nFrom stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,\nThrough bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,\nAnd diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,\nUntil he reach'd the great main cupola;\nThere standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,\nAnd from the basements deep to the high towers\nJarr'd his own golden region; and before\nThe quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,\nHis voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,\nTo this result: \"O dreams of day and night!\nO monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!\nO spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!\nO lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!\nWhy do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why\nIs my eternal essence thus distraught\nTo see and to behold these horrors new?\nSaturn is fallen, am I too to fall?\nAm I to leave this haven of my rest,\nThis cradle of my glory, this soft clime,\nThis calm luxuriance of blissful light,\nThese crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,\nOf all my lucent empire?\u00a0 It is left\nDeserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.\nThe blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,\nI cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness.\nEven here, into my centre of repose,\nThe shady visions come to domineer,\nInsult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.\u2014-\nFall!\u2014-No, by Tellus and her briny robes!\nOver the fiery frontier of my realms\nI will advance a terrible right arm\nShall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,\nAnd bid old Saturn take his throne again.\"\u2014-\nHe spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat\nHeld struggle with his throat but came not forth;\nFor as in theatres of crowded men\nHubbub increases more they call out \"Hush!\"\nSo at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale\nBestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;\nAnd from the mirror'd level where he stood\nA mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.\nAt this, through all his bulk an agony\nCrept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,\nLike a lithe serpent vast and muscular\nMaking slow way, with head and neck convuls'd\nFrom over-strained might.\u00a0 Releas'd, he fled\nTo the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours\nBefore the dawn in season due should blush,\nHe breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,\nClear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide\nSuddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.\nThe planet orb of fire, whereon he rode\nEach day from east to west the heavens through,\nSpun round in sable curtaining of clouds;\nNot therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,\nBut ever and anon the glancing spheres,\nCircles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,\nGlow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark\nSweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep\nUp to the zenith,\u2014-hieroglyphics old,\nWhich sages and keen-eyed astrologers\nThen living on the earth, with laboring thought\nWon from the gaze of many centuries:\nNow lost, save what we find on remnants huge\nOf stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,\nTheir wisdom long since fled.\u2014-Two wings this orb\nPossess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,\nEver exalted at the God's approach:\nAnd now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense\nRose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;\nWhile still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,\nAwaiting for Hyperion's command.\nFain would he have commanded, fain took throne\nAnd bid the day begin, if but for change.\nHe might not:\u2014-No, though a primeval God:\nThe sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.\nTherefore the operations of the dawn\nStay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.\nThose silver wings expanded sisterly,\nEager to sail their orb; the porches wide\nOpen'd upon the dusk demesnes of night\nAnd the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,\nUnus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent\nHis spirit to the sorrow of the time;\nAnd all along a dismal rack of clouds,\nUpon the boundaries of day and night,\nHe stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.\nThere as he lay, the Heaven with its stars\nLook'd down on him with pity, and the voice\nOf Coelus, from the universal space,\nThus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear:\n\"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born\nAnd sky-engendered, son of mysteries\nAll unrevealed even to the powers\nWhich met at thy creating; at whose joys\nAnd palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,\nI, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;\nAnd at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,\nDistinct, and visible; symbols divine,\nManifestations of that beauteous life\nDiffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:\nOf these new-form'd art thou, O brightest child!\nOf these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!\nThere is sad feud among ye, and rebellion\nOf son against his sire.\u00a0 I saw him fall,\nI saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!\nTo me his arms were spread, to me his voice\nFound way from forth the thunders round his head!\nPale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.\nArt thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:\nFor I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.\nDivine ye were created, and divine\nIn sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,\nUnruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:\nNow I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;\nActions of rage and passion; even as\nI see them, on the mortal world beneath,\nIn men who die.\u2014-This is the grief, O son!\nSad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!\nYet do thou strive; as thou art capable,\nAs thou canst move about, an evident God;\nAnd canst oppose to each malignant hour\nEthereal presence:\u2014-I am but a voice;\nMy life is but the life of winds and tides,\nNo more than winds and tides can I avail:\u2014-\nBut thou canst.\u2014-Be thou therefore in the van\nOf circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb\nBefore the tense string murmur.\u2014-To the earth!\nFor there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.\nMeantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,\nAnd of thy seasons be a careful nurse.\"\u2014-\nEre half this region-whisper had come down,\nHyperion arose, and on the stars\nLifted his curved lids, and kept them wide\nUntil it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:\nAnd still they were the same bright, patient stars.\nThen with a slow incline of his broad breast,\nLike to a diver in the pearly seas,\nForward he stoop'd over the airy shore,\nAnd plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.\n'Lord Houghton records, on the authority of Brown, that \"Hyperion\" was begun after the death of Tom Keats, when the poet took up his residence at Wentworth Place.\n(line 14): It seems to me that the power of realization shown in the first decade, and indeed throughout the fragment, answers all objections to the subject, and is the most absolute security for the nobility of the result which Keats would have achieved had he finished the poem. It is impossible to over-estimate the value of such a landscape, so touched in with a few strokes of titanic meaning and completeness; and the whole sentiment of gigantic despair reflected around the fallen god of the Titan dynasty, and permeating the landscape, is resumed in the most perfect manner in the incident of the motionless fallen leaf, a line almost as intense and full of the essence of poetry as any line in our language. It were ungracious to take exception to the poor Naiad; but she has not the convincing appropriateness of the rest of this sublime opening.'\n(line 51): Leigh Hunt's remarks upon Keats's failure to finish the poem are specially appropriate to this passage, \"If any living poet could finish this fragment, we believe it is the author himself. But perhaps he feels that he ought not. A story which involves passion, almost of necessity involves speech; and though we may well enough describe beings greater than ourselves by comparison, unfortunately we cannot make them speak by comparison.\"\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

{"title": "Hyperion. Book II", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings\nHyperion slid into the rustled air,\nAnd Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place\nWhere Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.\nIt was a den where no insulting light\nCould glimmer on their tears; where their own groans\nThey felt, but heard not, for the solid roar\nOf thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,\nPouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.\nCrag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd\nEver as if just rising from a sleep,\nForehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;\nAnd thus in thousand hugest phantasies\nMade a fit roofing to this nest of woe.\nInstead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,\nCouches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge\nStubborn'd with iron.\u00a0 All were not assembled:\nSome chain'd in torture, and some wandering.\nCaus, and Gyges, and Briareus,\nTyphon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,\nWith many more, the brawniest in assault,\nWere pent in regions of laborious breath;\nDungeon'd in opaque element, to keep\nTheir clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs\nLock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;\nWithout a motion, save of their big hearts\nHeaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd\nWith sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.\nMnemosyne was straying in the world;\nFar from her moon had Phoebe wandered;\nAnd many else were free to roam abroad,\nBut for the main, here found they covert drear.\nScarce images of life, one here, one there,\nLay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque\nOf Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,\nWhen the chill rain begins at shut of eve,\nIn dull November, and their chancel vault,\nThe Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.\nEach one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave\nOr word, or look, or action of despair.\nCreus was one; his ponderous iron mace\nLay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock\nTold of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.\nIapetus another; in his grasp,\nA serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue\nSqueez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length\nDead: and because the creature could not spit\nIts poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.\nNext Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,\nAs though in pain; for still upon the flint\nHe ground severe his skull, with open mouth\nAnd eyes at horrid working.\u00a0 Nearest him\nAsia, born of most enormous Caf,\nWho cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,\nThough feminine, than any of her sons:\nMore thought than woe was in her dusky face,\nFor she was prophesying of her glory;\nAnd in her wide imagination stood\nPalm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes\nBy Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.\nEven as Hope upon her anchor leans,\nSo leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk\nShed from the broadest of her elephants.\nAbove her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,\nUpon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,\nShadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild\nAs grazing ox unworried in the meads;\nNow tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,\nHe meditated, plotted, and even now\nWas hurling mountains in that second war,\nNot long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods\nTo hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.\nNot far hence Atlas; and beside him prone\nPhorcus, the sire of Gorgons.\u00a0 Neighbour'd close\nOceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap\nSobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.\nIn midst of all lay Themis, at the feet\nOf Ops the queen; all clouded round from sight,\nNo shape distinguishable, more than when\nThick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:\nAnd many else whose names may not be told.\nFor when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,\nWho shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt\nOf Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd\nWith damp and slippery footing from a depth\nMore horrid still. Above a sombre cliff\nTheir heads appear'd, and up their stature grew\nTill on the level height their steps found ease:\nThen Thea spread abroad her trembling arms\nUpon the precincts of this nest of pain,\nAnd sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:\nThere saw she direst strife; the supreme God\nAt war with all the frailty of grief,\nOf rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,\nRemorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.\nAgainst these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate\nHad pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,\nA disanointing poison: so that Thea,\nAffrighted, kept her still, and let him pass\nFirst onwards in, among the fallen tribe.\nAs with us mortal men, the laden heart\nIs persecuted more, and fever'd more,\nWhen it is nighing to the mournful house\nWhere other hearts are sick of the same bruise;\nSo Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,\nFelt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,\nBut that he met Enceladus's eye,\nWhose mightiness, and awe of him, at once\nCame like an inspiration; and he shouted,\n\"Titans, behold your God!\" at which some groan'd;\nSome started on their feet; some also shouted;\nSome wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;\nAnd Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,\nShow'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,\nHer eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.\nThere is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines\nWhen Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise\nAmong immortals when a God gives sign,\nWith hushing finger, how he means to load\nHis tongue with the filll weight of utterless thought,\nWith thunder, and with music, and with pomp:\nSuch noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;\nWhich, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,\nNo other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,\nAmong these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom\nGrew up like organ, that begins anew\nIts strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,\nLeave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.\nThus grew it up\u2014-\"Not in my own sad breast,\nWhich is its own great judge and searcher out,\nCan I find reason why ye should be thus:\nNot in the legends of the first of days,\nStudied from that old spirit-leaved book\nWhich starry Uranus with finger bright\nSav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves\nLow-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;\u2014-\nAnd the which book ye know I ever kept\nFor my firm-based footstool:\u2014-Ah, infirm!\nNot there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent\nOf element, earth, water, air, and fire,\u2014-\nAt war, at peace, or inter-quarreling\nOne against one, or two, or three, or all\nEach several one against the other three,\nAs fire with air loud warring when rain-floods\nDrown both, and press them both against earth's face,\nWhere, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath\nUnhinges the poor world;\u2014-not in that strife,\nWherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,\nCan I find reason why ye should be thus:\nNo, nowhere can unriddle, though I search,\nAnd pore on Nature's universal scroll\nEven to swooning, why ye, Divinities,\nThe first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,\nShould cower beneath what, in comparison,\nIs untremendous might. Yet ye are here,\nO'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!\nO Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'\u2014-Ye groan:\nShall I say 'Crouch!'\u2014-Ye groan. What can I then?\nO Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!\nWhat can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,\nHow we can war, how engine our great wrath!\nO speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear\nIs all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,\nPonderest high and deep; and in thy face\nI see, astonied, that severe content\nSo ended Saturn; and the God of the sea,\nSophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,\nBut cogitation in his watery shades,\nArose, with locks not oozy, and began,\nIn murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue\nCaught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.\n\"O ye, whom wrath consumes!\u00a0 who, passion-stung,\nWrithe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!\nShut up your senses, stifle up your ears,\nMy voice is not a bellows unto ire.\nYet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof\nHow ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:\nAnd in the proof much comfort will I give,\nIf ye will take that comfort in its truth.\nWe fall by course of Nature's law, not force\nOf thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou\nHast sifted well the atom-universe;\nBut for this reason, that thou art the King,\nAnd only blind from sheer supremacy,\nOne avenue was shaded from thine eyes,\nThrough which I wandered to eternal truth.\nAnd first, as thou wast not the first of powers,\nSo art thou not the last; it cannot be:\nThou art not the beginning nor the end.\nFrom Chaos and parental Darkness came\nLight, the first fruits of that intestine broil,\nThat sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends\nWas ripening in itself.\u00a0 The ripe hour came,\nAnd with it Light, and Light, engendering\nUpon its own producer, forthwith touch'd\nThe whole enormous matter into life.\nUpon that very hour, our parentage,\nThe Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:\nThen thou first born, and we the giant race,\nFound ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.\nNow comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;\nO folly! for to bear all naked truths,\nAnd to envisage circumstance, all calm,\nThat is the top of sovereignty.\u00a0 Mark well!\nAs Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far\nThan Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;\nAnd as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth\nIn form and shape compact and beautiful,\nIn will, in action free, companionship,\nAnd thousand other signs of purer life;\nSo on our heels a fresh perfection treads,\nA power more strong in beauty, born of us\nAnd fated to excel us, as we pass\nIn glory that old Darkness: nor are we\nThereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule\nOf shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil\nQuarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,\nAnd feedeth still, more comely than itself?\nCan it deny the chiefdom of green groves?\nOr shall the tree be envious of the dove\nBecause it cooeth, and hath snowy wings\nTo wander wherewithal and find its joys?\nWe are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs\nHave bred forth, not pale solitary doves,\nBut eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower\nAbove us in their beauty, and must reign\nIn right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law\nThat first in beauty should be first in might:\nYea, by that law, another race may drive\nOur conquerors to mourn as we do now.\nHave ye beheld the young God of the seas,\nMy dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?\nHave ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along\nBy noble winged creatures he hath made?\nI saw him on the calmed waters scud,\nWith such a glow of beauty in his eyes,\nThat it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell\nTo all my empire: farewell sad I took,\nAnd hither came, to see how dolorous fate\nHad wrought upon ye; and how I might best\nGive consolation in this woe extreme.\nReceive the truth, and let it be your balm.\"\nWhether through pos'd conviction, or disdain,\nThey guarded silence, when Oceanus\nLeft murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?\nBut so it was, none answer'd for a space,\nSave one whom none regarded, Clymene;\nAnd yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,\nWith hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,\nThus wording timidly among the fierce:\n\"O Father! I am here the simplest voice,\nAnd all my knowledge is that joy is gone,\nAnd this thing woe crept in among our hearts,\nThere to remain for ever, as I fear:\nI would not bode of evil, if I thought\nWhich by just right should come of mighty Gods;\nYet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell\nOf what I heard, and how it made me weep,\nAnd know that we had parted from all hope.\nI stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,\nWhere a sweet clime was breathed from a land\nOf fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.\nFull of calm joy it was, as I of grief;\nToo full of joy and soft delicious warmth;\nSo that I felt a movement in my heart\nTo chide, and to reproach that solitude\nWith songs of misery, music of our woes;\nAnd sat me down, and took a mouthed shell\nAnd murmur'd into it, and made melody\u2014-\nO melody no more! for while I sang,\nAnd with poor skill let pass into the breeze\nThe dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand\nJust opposite, an island of the sea,\nThere came enchantment with the shifting wind,\nThat did both drown and keep alive my ears.\nI threw my shell away upon the sand,\nAnd a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd\nWith that new blissful golden melody.\nA living death was in each gush of sounds,\nEach family of rapturous hurried notes,\nThat fell, one after one, yet all at once,\nLike pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:\nAnd then another, then another strain,\nEach like a dove leaving its olive perch,\nWith music wing'd instead of silent plumes,\nTo hover round my head, and make me sick\nOf joy and grief at once.\u00a0 Grief overcame,\nAnd I was stopping up my frantic ears,\nWhen, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,\nA voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,\nAnd still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!\nThe morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'\nO Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt\nThose pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,\nYe would not call this too indulged tongue\nPresumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.\"\nSo far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook\nThat, lingering along a pebbled coast,\nDoth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,\nAnd shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice\nOf huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:\nThe ponderous syllables, like sullen waves\nIn the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,\nCame booming thus, while still upon his arm\nHe lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.\n\"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,\nOr to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?\nNot thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all\nThat rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent,\nNot world on world upon these shoulders piled,\nCould agonize me more than baby-words\nIn midst of this dethronement horrible.\nSpeak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.\nDo ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?\nAre ye not smitten by a youngling arm?\nDost thou forget, sham Monarch of the waves,\nThy scalding in the seas?\u00a0 What! have I rous'd\nYour spleens with so few simple words as these?\nO joy! for now I see ye are not lost:\nO joy! for now I see a thousand eyes\nWide-glaring for revenge!\"\u2014-As this he said,\nHe lifted up his stature vast, and stood,\nStill without intermission speaking thus:\n\"Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,\nAnd purge the ether of our enemies;\nHow to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,\nAnd singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,\nStifling that puny essence in its tent.\nO let him feel the evil he hath done;\nFor though I scorn Oceanus's lore,\nMuch pain have I for more than loss of realms:\nThe days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;\nThose days, all innocent of scathing war,\nWhen all the fair Existences of heaven\nCarne open-eyed to guess what we would speak:\u2014-\nThat was before our brows were taught to frown,\nBefore our lips knew else but solemn sounds;\nThat was before we knew the winged thing,\nVictory, might be lost, or might be won.\nAnd be ye mindful that Hyperion,\nOur brightest brother, still is undisgraced\u2014-\nHyperion, lo!

{"title": "I Stood Tip-Toe Upon A Little Hill", "author": "John Keats", "text": "I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,\nThe air was cooling, and so very still,\nThat the sweet buds which with a modest pride\nPull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,\nTheir scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,\nHad not yet lost those starry diadems\nCaught from the early sobbing of the morn.\nThe clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,\nAnd fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept\nOn the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept\nA little noiseless noise among the leaves,\nBorn of the very sigh that silence heaves:\nFor not the faintest motion could be seen\nOf all the shades that slanted o\u2019er the green.\nThere was wide wand\u2019ring for the greediest eye,\nTo peer about upon variety;\nFar round the horizon\u2019s crystal air to skim,\nAnd trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;\nTo picture out the quaint, and curious bending\nOf a fresh woodland alley, never ending;\nOr by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,\nGuess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves.\nI gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free\nAs though the fanning wings of Mercury\nHad played upon my heels: I was light-hearted,\nAnd many pleasures to my vision started;\nSo I straightway began to pluck a posey\nOf luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.\nA bush of May flowers with the bees about them;\nAh, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;\nAnd let a lush laburnum oversweep them,\nAnd let long grass grow round the roots to keep them\nMoist, cool and green; and shade the violets,\nThat they may bind the moss in leafy nets.\nA filbert hedge with wildbriar overtwined,\nAnd clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind\nUpon their summer thrones; there too should be\nThe frequent chequer of a youngling tree,\nThat with a score of light green breth[r]en shoots\nFrom the quaint mossiness of aged roots:\nRound which is heard a spring-head of clear waters\nBabbling so wildly of its lovely daughters\nThe spreading blue bells: it may haply mourn\nThat such fair clusters should be rudely torn\nFrom their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly\nBy infant hands, left on the path to die.\nOpen afresh your round of starry folds,\nYe ardent marigolds!\nDry up the moisture from your golden lids,\nFor great Apollo bids\nThat in these days your praises should be sung\nOn many harps, which he has lately strung;\nAnd when again your dewiness he kisses,\nTell him, I have you in my world of blisses:\nSo haply when I rove in some far vale,\nHis mighty voice may come upon the gale.\nHere are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight:\nWith wings of gentle flush o\u2019er delicate white,\nAnd taper fingers catching at all things,\nTo bind them all about with tiny rings.\nLinger awhile upon some bending planks\nThat lean against a streamlet\u2019s rushy banks,\nAnd watch intently Nature\u2019s gentle doings:\nThey will be found softer than ring-dove\u2019s cooings.\nHow silent comes the water round that bend;\nNot the minutest whisper does it send\nTo the o\u2019erhanging sallows: blades of grass\nSlowly across the chequer\u2019d shadows pass.\nWhy, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach\nTo where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach\nA natural sermon o\u2019er their pebbly beds;\nWhere swarms of minnows show their little heads,\nStaying their wavy bodies \u2019gainst the streams,\nTo taste the luxury of sunny beams\nTemper\u2019d with coolness. How they ever wrestle\nWith their own sweet delight, and ever nestle\nTheir silver bellies on the pebbly sand.\nIf you but scantily hold out the hand,\nThat very instant not one will remain;\nBut turn your eye, and they are there again.\nThe ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,\nAnd cool themselves among the em\u2019rald tresses;\nThe while they cool themselves, they freshness give,\nAnd moisture, that the bowery green may live:\nSo keeping up an interchange of favours,\nLike good men in the truth of their behaviours.\nSometimes goldfinches one by one will drop\nFrom low hung branches; little space they stop;\nBut sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;\nThen off at once, as in a wanton freak:\nOr perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings\nPausing upon their yellow flutterings.\nWere I in such a place, I sure should pray\nThat nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,\nThan the soft rustle of a maiden\u2019s gown\nFanning away the dandelion\u2019s down;\nThan the light music of her nimble toes\nPatting against the sorrel as she goes.\nHow she would start, and blush, thus to be caught\nPlaying in all her innocence of thought.\nO let me lead her gently o\u2019er the brook,\nWatch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;\nO let me for one moment touch her wrist;\nLet me one moment to her breathing list;\nAnd as she leaves me may she often turn\nHer fair eyes looking through her locks auburne.\nWhat next? A tuft of evening primroses,\nO\u2019er which the mind may hover till it dozes;\nO\u2019er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,\nBut that \u2019tis ever startled by the leap\nOf buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting\nOf diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;\nOr by the moon lifting her silver rim\nAbove a cloud, and with a gradual swim\nComing into the blue with all her light.\nO Maker of sweet poets, dear delight\nOf this fair world, and all its gentle livers;\nSpangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,\nMingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,\nCloser of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,\nLover of loneliness, and wandering,\nOf upcast eye, and tender pondering!\nThee must I praise above all other glories\nThat smile us on to tell delightful stories.\nBut the fair paradise of Nature\u2019s light?\nIn the calm grandeur of a sober line,\nWe see the waving of the mountain pine;\nAnd when a tale is beautifully staid,\nWe feel the safety of a hawthorn glade:\nWhen it is moving on luxurious wings,\nThe soul is lost in pleasant smotherings:\nFair dewy roses brush against our faces,\nAnd flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;\nO\u2019erhead we see the jasmine and sweet briar,\nAnd bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;\nWhile at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles\nCharms us at once away from all our troubles:\nSo that we feel uplifted from the world,\nWalking upon the white clouds wreath\u2019d and curl\u2019d.\nSo felt he, who first told, how Psyche went\nOn the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;\nWhat Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips\nFirst touch\u2019d; what amorous and fondling nips\nThey gave each other\u2019s cheeks; with all their sighs,\nAnd how they kist each other\u2019s tremulous eyes:\nThe silver lamp,\u2014the ravishment,\u2014the wonder\u2014\nThe darkness,\u2014loneliness,\u2014the fearful thunder;\nTheir woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,\nTo bow for gratitude before Jove\u2019s throne.\nSo did he feel, who pull\u2019d the boughs aside,\nThat we might look into a forest wide,\nTo catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades\nComing with softest rustle through the trees;\nAnd garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,\nUpheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet:\nTelling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled\nArcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.\nPoor Nymph,\u2014poor Pan,\u2014how did he weep to find,\nNought but a lovely sighing of the wind\nAlong the reedy stream; a half heard strain,\nFull of sweet desolation\u2014balmy pain.\nWhat first inspired a bard of old to sing\nNarcissus pining o\u2019er the untainted spring?\nIn some delicious ramble, he had found\nA little space, with boughs all woven round;\nAnd in the midst of all, a clearer pool\nThan e\u2019er reflected in its pleasant cool,\nThe blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping\nThrough tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.\nAnd on the bank a lonely flower he spied,\nA meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,\nDrooping its beauty o\u2019er the watery clearness,\nTo woo its own sad image into nearness:\nDeaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;\nBut still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.\nSo while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,\nSome fainter gleamings o\u2019er his fancy shot;\nNor was it long ere he had told the tale\nOf young Narcissus, and sad Echo\u2019s bale.\nWhere had he been, from whose warm head out-flew\nThat sweetest of all songs, that ever new,\nThat aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,\nComing ever to bless\nThe wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing\nShapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing\nFrom out the middle air, from flowery nests,\nAnd from the pillowy silkiness that rests\nFull in the speculation of the stars.\nAh! surely he had burst our mortal bars;\nInto some wond\u2019rous region he had gone,\nTo search for thee, divine Endymion!\nHe was a Poet, sure a lover too,\nWho stood on Latmus\u2019 top, what time there blew\nSoft breezes from the myrtle vale below;\nAnd brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow\nA hymn from Dian\u2019s temple; while upswelling,\nThe incense went to her own starry dwelling.\nBut though her face was clear as infant\u2019s eyes,\nThough she stood smiling o\u2019er the sacrifice,\nThe Poet wept at her so piteous fate,\nWept that such beauty should be desolate:\nSo in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,\nAnd gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.\nQueen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen\nOf all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!\nAs thou exceedest all things in thy shine,\nSo every tale, does this sweet tale of thine.\nO for three words of honey, that I might\nTell but one wonder of thy bridal night!\nWhere distant ships do seem to show their keels,\nPhoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,\nAnd turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,\nEre he his unseen pomp would solemnize.\nThe evening weather was so bright, and clear,\nThat men of health were of unusual cheer;\nStepping like Homer at the trumpet\u2019s call,\nOr young Apollo on the pedestal:\nAnd lovely women were as fair and warm,\nAs Venus looking sideways in alarm.\nThe breezes were ethereal, and pure,\nAnd crept through half closed lattices to cure\nThe languid sick; it cool\u2019d their fever\u2019d sleep,\nAnd soothed them into slumbers full and deep.\nSoon they awoke clear eyed: nor burnt with thirsting\nNor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting:\nAnd springing up, they met the wond\u2019ring sight\nOf their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;\nWho feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,\nAnd on their placid foreheads part the hair.\nYoung men, and maidens at each other gaz\u2019d\nWith hands held back, and motionless, amaz\u2019d\nTo see the brightness in each others\u2019 eyes;\nAnd so they stood, fill\u2019d with a sweet surprise,\nUntil their tongues were loos\u2019d in poesy.\nTherefore no lover did of anguish die:\nBut the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,\nMade silken ties, that never may be broken.\nCynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses,\nWas there a Poet born?\u2014but now no more,\nMy wand\u2019ring spirit must no further soar.\nI stood tip-toe upon a little hill : Leigh Hunt tells us in 'Lord Byron and Some of his Contemporaries' that \"this poem was suggested to Keats by a delightful summer's-day, as he stood beside the gate that leads from the Battery on Hampstead Heath into a field by Caen Wood.\"\n(lines 37-41) Of this passage Hunt says, \"Any body who has seen a throng of young beeches, furnishing those natural clumpy seats at the root, must recognize the truth and grace of this description.\" He adds that the remainder of the poem, especially verses 47 to 86, \"affords an exquisite proof of close observation of nature as well as the most luxuriant fancy.\"\n(lines 61-80) Charles Cowden Clarke says Keats told him this passage was the recollection of the friends' \"having frequently loitered over the rail of a foot-bridge that spanned ... a little brook in the last field upon entering Edmonton.\" Keats, he says, \"thought the picture correct, and acknowledged to a partiality for it.\"\n~The Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

{"title": "Isabella; Or, The Pot Of Basil: A Story From Boccaccio", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Fair Isabel, poor simple Isabel!\nLorenzo, a young palmer in Love's eye!\nThey could not in the self-same mansion dwell\nWithout some stir of heart, some malady;\nThey could not sit at meals but feel how well\nIt soothed each to be the other by;\nThey could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep\nBut to each other dream, and nightly weep.\nII.\nWith every morn their love grew tenderer,\nWith every eve deeper and tenderer still;\nHe might not in house, field, or garden stir,\nBut her full shape would all his seeing fill;\nAnd his continual voice was pleasanter\nTo her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;\nHer lute-string gave an echo of his name,\nShe spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.\nIII.\nHe knew whose gentle hand was at the latch,\nBefore the door had given her to his eyes;\nAnd from her chamber-window he would catch\nHer beauty farther than the falcon spies;\nAnd constant as her vespers would he watch,\nBecause her face was turn'd to the same skies;\nAnd with sick longing all the night outwear,\nTo hear her morning-step upon the stair.\nIV.\nA whole long month of May in this sad plight\nMade their cheeks paler by the break of June:\n\"To morrow will I bow to my delight,\n\"To-morrow will I ask my lady's boon.\"\u2014\n\"O may I never see another night,\n\"Lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not love's tune.\"\u2014\nSo spake they to their pillows; but, alas,\nHoneyless days and days did he let pass;\nUntil sweet Isabella's untouch'd cheek\nFell sick within the rose's just domain,\nFell thin as a young mother's, who doth seek\nBy every lull to cool her infant's pain:\n\"How ill she is,\" said he, \"I may not speak,\n\"And yet I will, and tell my love all plain:\n\"If looks speak love-laws, I will drink her tears,\n\"And at the least 'twill startle off her cares.\"\nVI.\nSo said he one fair morning, and all day\nHis heart beat awfully against his side;\nAnd to his heart he inwardly did pray\nFor power to speak; but still the ruddy tide\nStifled his voice, and puls'd resolve away\u2014\nFever'd his high conceit of such a bride,\nYet brought him to the meekness of a child:\nAlas! when passion is both meek and wild!\nVII.\nSo once more he had wak'd and anguished\nA dreary night of love and misery,\nIf Isabel's quick eye had not been wed\nTo every symbol on his forehead high;\nShe saw it waxing very pale and dead,\nAnd straight all flush'd; so, lisped tenderly,\n\"Lorenzo!\"\u2014here she ceas'd her timid quest,\nBut in her tone and look he read the rest.\nVIII.\n\"O Isabella, I can half perceive\n\"That I may speak my grief into thine ear;\n\"If thou didst ever any thing believe,\n\"Believe how I love thee, believe how near\n\"My soul is to its doom: I would not grieve\n\"Thy hand by unwelcome pressing, would not fear\n\"Thine eyes by gazing; but I cannot live\n\"Another night, and not my passion shrive.\nIX.\n\"Love! thou art leading me from wintry cold,\n\"Lady! thou leadest me to summer clime,\n\"And I must taste the blossoms that unfold\n\"In its ripe warmth this gracious morning time.\"\nSo said, his erewhile timid lips grew bold,\nAnd poesied with hers in dewy rhyme:\nGreat bliss was with them, and great happiness\nGrew, like a lusty flower in June's caress.\nParting they seem'd to tread upon the air,\nTwin roses by the zephyr blown apart\nOnly to meet again more close, and share\nThe inward fragrance of each other's heart.\nShe, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair\nSang, of delicious love and honey'd dart;\nHe with light steps went up a western hill,\nAnd bade the sun farewell, and joy'd his fill.\nXI.\nAll close they met again, before the dusk\nHad taken from the stars its pleasant veil,\nAll close they met, all eves, before the dusk\nHad taken from the stars its pleasant veil,\nClose in a bower of hyacinth and musk,\nUnknown of any, free from whispering tale.\nAh! better had it been for ever so,\nThan idle ears should pleasure in their woe.\nXII.\nWere they unhappy then?\u2014It cannot be\u2014\nToo many tears for lovers have been shed,\nToo many sighs give we to them in fee,\nToo much of pity after they are dead,\nToo many doleful stories do we see,\nWhose matter in bright gold were best be read;\nExcept in such a page where Theseus' spouse\nOver the pathless waves towards him bows.\nXIII.\nBut, for the general award of love,\nThe little sweet doth kill much bitterness;\nThough Dido silent is in under-grove,\nAnd Isabella's was a great distress,\nThough young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove\nWas not embalm'd, this truth is not the less\u2014\nEven bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,\nKnow there is richest juice in poison-flowers.\nXIV.\nWith her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,\nEnriched from ancestral merchandize,\nAnd for them many a weary hand did swelt\nIn torched mines and noisy factories,\nAnd many once proud-quiver'd loins did melt\nIn blood from stinging whip;\u2014with hollow eyes\nMany all day in dazzling river stood,\nTo take the rich-ored driftings of the flood.\nXV.\nFor them the Ceylon diver held his breath,\nAnd went all naked to the hungry shark;\nFor them his ears gush'd blood; for them in death\nThe seal on the cold ice with piteous bark\nLay full of darts; for them alone did seethe\nA thousand men in troubles wide and dark:\nHalf-ignorant, they turn'd an easy wheel,\nThat set sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel.\nXVI.\nWhy were they proud? Because their marble founts\nGush'd with more pride than do a wretch's tears?\u2014\nWhy were they proud? Because fair orange-mounts\nWere of more soft ascent than lazar stairs?\u2014\nWhy were they proud? Because red-lin'd accounts\nWere richer than the songs of Grecian years?\u2014\nWhy were they proud? again we ask aloud,\nWhy in the name of Glory were they proud?\nXVII.\nYet were these Florentines as self-retired\nIn hungry pride and gainful cowardice,\nAs two close Hebrews in that land inspired,\nPaled in and vineyarded from beggar-spies,\nThe hawks of ship-mast forests\u2014the untired\nAnd pannier'd mules for ducats and old lies\u2014\nQuick cat's-paws on the generous stray-away,\u2014\nGreat wits in Spanish, Tuscan, and Malay.\nXVIII.\nHow was it these same ledger-men could spy\nFair Isabella in her downy nest?\nHow could they find out in Lorenzo's eye\nA straying from his toil? Hot Egypt's pest\nInto their vision covetous and sly!\nHow could these money-bags see east and west?\u2014\nYet so they did\u2014and every dealer fair\nMust see behind, as doth the hunted hare.\nXIX.\nO eloquent and famed Boccaccio!\nOf thee we now should ask forgiving boon,\nAnd of thy spicy myrtles as they blow,\nAnd of thy roses amorous of the moon,\nAnd of thy lilies, that do paler grow\nNow they can no more hear thy ghittern's tune,\nFor venturing syllables that ill beseem\nThe quiet glooms of such a piteous theme.\nXX.\nGrant thou a pardon here, and then the tale\nShall move on soberly, as it is meet;\nThere is no other crime, no mad assail\nTo make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet:\nBut it is done\u2014succeed the verse or fail\u2014\nTo honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet;\nTo stead thee as a verse in English tongue,\nAn echo of thee in the north-wind sung.\nXXI.\nThese brethren having found by many signs\nWhat love Lorenzo for their sister had,\nAnd how she lov'd him too, each unconfines\nHis bitter thoughts to other, well nigh mad\nThat he, the servant of their trade designs,\nShould in their sister's love be blithe and glad,\nWhen 'twas their plan to coax her by degrees\nTo some high noble and his olive-trees.\nXXII.\nAnd many a jealous conference had they,\nAnd many times they bit their lips alone,\nBefore they fix'd upon a surest way\nTo make the youngster for his crime atone;\nAnd at the last, these men of cruel clay\nCut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone;\nFor they resolved in some forest dim\nTo kill Lorenzo, and there bury him.\nXXIII.\nSo on a pleasant morning, as he leant\nInto the sun-rise, o'er the balustrade\nOf the garden-terrace, towards him they bent\nTheir footing through the dews; and to him said,\n\"You seem there in the quiet of content,\n\"Lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade\n\"Calm speculation; but if you are wise,\n\"Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies.\nXXIV.\n\"To-day we purpose, ay, this hour we mount\n\"To spur three leagues towards the Apennine;\n\"Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count\n\"His dewy rosary on the eglantine.\"\nLorenzo, courteously as he was wont,\nBow'd a fair greeting to these serpents' whine;\nAnd went in haste, to get in readiness,\nWith belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman's dress.\nXXV.\nAnd as he to the court-yard pass'd along,\nEach third step did he pause, and listen'd oft\nIf he could hear his lady's matin-song,\nOr the light whisper of her footstep soft;\nAnd as he thus over his passion hung,\nHe heard a laugh full musical aloft;\nWhen, looking up, he saw her features bright\nSmile through an in-door lattice, all delight.\nXXVI.\n\"Love, Isabel!\" said he, \"I was in pain\n\"Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow:\n\"Ah! what if I should lose thee, when so fain\n\"I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow\n\"Of a poor three hours' absence? but we'll gain\n\"Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow.\n\"Good bye! I'll soon be back.\"\u2014\"Good bye!\" said she:\u2014\nAnd as he went she chanted merrily.\nXXVII.\nSo the two brothers and their murder'd man\nRode past fair Florence, to where Arno's stream\nGurgles through straiten'd banks, and still doth fan\nItself with dancing bulrush, and the bream\nKeeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan\nThe brothers' faces in the ford did seem,\nLorenzo's flush with love.\u2014They pass'd the water\nInto a forest quiet for the slaughter.\nXXVIII.\nThere was Lorenzo slain and buried in,\nThere in that forest did his great love cease;\nAh! when a soul doth thus its freedom win,\nIt aches in loneliness\u2014is ill at peace\nAs the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin:\nThey dipp'd their swords in the water, and did tease\nTheir horses homeward, with convulsed spur,\nEach richer by his being a murderer.\nXXIX.\nThey told their sister how, with sudden speed,\nLorenzo had ta'en ship for foreign lands,\nBecause of some great urgency and need\nIn their affairs, requiring trusty hands.\nPoor Girl! put on thy stifling widow's weed,\nAnd 'scape at once from Hope's accursed bands;\nTo-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow,\nAnd the next day will be a day of sorrow.\nXXX.\nShe weeps alone for pleasures not to be;\nSorely she wept until the night came on,\nAnd then, instead of love, O misery!\nShe brooded o'er the luxury alone:\nHis image in the dusk she seem'd to see,\nAnd to the silence made a gentle moan,\nSpreading her perfect arms upon the air,\nAnd on her couch low murmuring, \"Where? O where?\"\nXXXI.\nBut Selfishness, Love's cousin, held not long\nIts fiery vigil in her single breast;\nShe fretted for the golden hour, and hung\nUpon the time with feverish unrest\u2014\nNot long\u2014for soon into her heart a throng\nOf higher occupants, a richer zest,\nCame tragic; passion not to be subdued,\nAnd sorrow for her love in travels rude.\nXXXII.\nIn the mid days of autumn, on their eves\nThe breath of Winter comes from far away,\nAnd the sick west continually bereaves\nOf some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay\nOf death among the bushes and the leaves,\nTo make all bare before he dares to stray\nFrom his north cavern. So sweet Isabel\nBy gradual decay from beauty fell,\nXXXIII.\nBecause Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes\nShe ask'd her brothers, with an eye all pale,\nStriving to be itself, what dungeon climes\nCould keep him off so long? They spake a tale\nTime after time, to quiet her. Their crimes\nCame on them, like a smoke from Hinnom's vale;\nAnd every night in dreams they groan'd aloud,\nTo see their sister in her snowy shroud.\nXXXIV.\nAnd she had died in drowsy ignorance,\nBut for a thing more deadly dark than all;\nIt came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,\nWhich saves a sick man from the feather'd pall\nFor some few gasping moments; like a lance,\nWaking an Indian from his cloudy hall\nWith cruel pierce, and bringing him again\nSense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.\nXXXV.\nIt was a vision.\u2014In the drowsy gloom,\nThe dull of midnight, at her couch's foot\nLorenzo stood, and wept: the forest tomb\nHad marr'd his glossy hair which once could shoot\nLustre into the sun, and put cold doom\nUpon his lips, and taken the soft lute\nFrom his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears\nHad made a miry channel for his tears.\nXXXVI.\nStrange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake;\nFor there was striving, in its piteous tongue,\nTo speak as when on earth it was awake,\nAnd Isabella on its music hung:\nLanguor there was in it, and tremulous shake,\nAs in a palsied Druid's harp unstrung;\nAnd through it moan'd a ghostly under-song,\nLike hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.\nXXXVII.\nIts eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright\nWith love, and kept all phantom fear aloof\nFrom the poor girl by magic of their light,\nThe while it did unthread the horrid woof\nOf the late darken'd time,\u2014the murderous spite\nOf pride and avarice,\u2014the dark pine roof\nIn the forest,\u2014and the sodden turfed dell,\nWhere, without any word, from stabs he fell.\nXXXVIII.\nSaying moreover, \"Isabel, my sweet!\n\"Red whortle-berries droop above my head,\n\"And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;\n\"Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed\n\"Their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheep-fold bleat\n\"Comes from beyond the river to my bed:\n\"Go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom,\n\"And it shall comfort me within the tomb.\nXXXIX.\n\"I am a shadow now, alas! alas!\n\"Upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling\n\"Alone: I chant alone the holy mass,\n\"While little sounds of life are round me knelling,\n\"And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,\n\"And many a chapel bell the hour is telling,\n\"Paining me through: those sounds grow strange to me,\n\"And thou art distant in Humanity.\nXL.\n\"I know what was, I feel full well what is,\n\"And I should rage, if spirits could go mad;\n\"Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss,\n\"That paleness warms my grave, as though I had\n\"A Seraph chosen from the bright abyss\n\"To be my spouse: thy paleness makes me glad;\n\"Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel\n\"A greater love through all my essence steal.\"\nXLI.\nThe Spirit mourn'd \"Adieu!\"\u2014dissolv'd, and left\nThe atom darkness in a slow turmoil;\nAs when of healthful midnight sleep bereft,\nThinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,\nWe put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,\nAnd see the spangly gloom froth up and boil:\nIt made sad Isabella's eyelids ache,\nAnd in the dawn she started up awake;\nXLII.\n\"Ha! ha!\" said she, \"I knew not this hard life,\n\"I thought the worst was simple misery;\n\"I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife\n\"Portion'd us\u2014happy days, or else to die;\n\"But there is crime\u2014a brother's bloody knife!\n\"Sweet Spirit, thou hast school'd my infancy:\n\"I'll visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,\n\"And greet thee morn and even in the skies.\"\nXLIII.\nWhen the full morning came, she had devised\nHow she might secret to the forest hie;\nHow she might find the clay, so dearly prized,\nAnd sing to it one latest lullaby;\nHow her short absence might be unsurmised,\nWhile she the inmost of the dream would try.\nResolv'd, she took with her an aged nurse,\nAnd went into that dismal forest-hearse.\nXLIV.\nSee, as they creep along the river side,\nHow she doth whisper to that aged Dame,\nAnd, after looking round the champaign wide,\nShows her a knife.\u2014\"What feverous hectic flame\n\"Burns in thee, child?\u2014What good can thee betide,\n\"That thou should'st smile again?\"\u2014The evening came,\nAnd they had found Lorenzo's earthy bed;\nThe flint was there, the berries at his head.\nXLV.\nWho hath not loiter'd in a green church-yard,\nAnd let his spirit, like a demon-mole,\nWork through the clayey soil and gravel hard,\nTo see skull, coffin'd bones, and funeral stole;\nPitying each form that hungry Death hath marr'd,\nAnd filling it once more with human soul?\nAh! this is holiday to what was felt\nWhen Isabella by Lorenzo knelt.\nXLVI.\nShe gaz'd into the fresh-thrown mould, as though\nOne glance did fully all its secrets tell;\nClearly she saw, as other eyes would know\nPale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;\nUpon the murderous spot she seem'd to grow,\nLike to a native lily of the dell:\nThen with her knife, all sudden, she began\nTo dig more fervently than misers can.\nXLVII.\nSoon she turn'd up a soiled glove, whereon\nHer silk had play'd in purple phantasies,\nShe kiss'd it with a lip more chill than stone,\nAnd put it in her bosom, where it dries\nAnd freezes utterly unto the bone\nThose dainties made to still an infant's cries:\nThen 'gan she work again; nor stay'd her care,\nBut to throw back at times her veiling hair.\nXLVIII.\nThat old nurse stood beside her wondering,\nUntil her heart felt pity to the core\nAt sight of such a dismal labouring,\nAnd so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,\nAnd put her lean hands to the horrid thing:\nThree hours they labour'd at this travail sore;\nAt last they felt the kernel of the grave,\nAnd Isabella did not stamp and rave.\nXLIX.\nAh! wherefore all this wormy circumstance?\nWhy linger at the yawning tomb so long?\nO for the gentleness of old Romance,\nThe simple plaining of a minstrel's song!\nFair reader, at the old tale take a glance,\nFor here, in truth, it doth not well belong\nTo speak:\u2014O turn thee to the very tale,\nAnd taste the music of that vision pale.\nWith duller steel than the Pers\u00e8an sword\nThey cut away no formless monster's head,\nBut one, whose gentleness did well accord\nWith death, as life. The ancient harps have said,\nLove never dies, but lives, immortal Lord:\nIf Love impersonate was ever dead,\nPale Isabella kiss'd it, and low moan'd.\n'Twas love; cold,\u2014dead indeed, but not dethroned.\nLI.\nIn anxious secrecy they took it home,\nAnd then the prize was all for Isabel:\nShe calm'd its wild hair with a golden comb,\nAnd all around each eye's sepulchral cell\nPointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam\nWith tears, as chilly as a dripping well,\nShe drench'd away:\u2014and still she comb'd, and kept\nSighing all day\u2014and still she kiss'd, and wept.\nLII.\nThen in a silken scarf,\u2014sweet with the dews\nOf precious flowers pluck'd in Araby,\nAnd divine liquids come with odorous ooze\nThrough the cold serpent pipe refreshfully,\u2014\nShe wrapp'd it up; and for its tomb did choose\nA garden-pot, wherein she laid it by,\nAnd cover'd it with mould, and o'er it set\nSweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet.\nLIII.\nAnd she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,\nAnd she forgot the blue above the trees,\nAnd she forgot the dells where waters run,\nAnd she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;\nShe had no knowledge when the day was done,\nAnd the new morn she saw not: but in peace\nHung over her sweet Basil evermore,\nAnd moisten'd it with tears unto the core.\nLIV.\nAnd so she ever fed it with thin tears,\nWhence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,\nSo that it smelt more balmy than its peers\nOf Basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew\nNurture besides, and life, from human fears,\nFrom the fast mouldering head there shut from view:\nSo that the jewel, safely casketed,\nCame forth, and in perfumed leafits spread.\nLV.\nO Melancholy, linger here awhile!\nO Music, Music, breathe despondingly!\nO Echo, Echo, from some sombre isle,\nUnknown, Lethean, sigh to us\u2014O sigh!\nSpirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile;\nLift up your heads, sweet Spirits, heavily,\nAnd make a pale light in your cypress glooms,\nTinting with silver wan your marble tombs.\nLVI.\nMoan hither, all ye syllables of woe,\nFrom the deep throat of sad Melpomene!\nThrough bronzed lyre in tragic order go,\nAnd touch the strings into a mystery;\nSound mournfully upon the winds and low;\nFor simple Isabel is soon to be\nAmong the dead: She withers, like a palm\nCut by an Indian for its juicy balm.\nLVII.\nO leave the palm to wither by itself;\nLet not quick Winter chill its dying hour!\u2014\nIt may not be\u2014those Baalites of pelf,\nHer brethren, noted the continual shower\nFrom her dead eyes; and many a curious elf,\nAmong her kindred, wonder'd that such dower\nOf youth and beauty should be thrown aside\nBy one mark'd out to be a Noble's bride.\nLVIII.\nAnd, furthermore, her brethren wonder'd much\nWhy she sat drooping by the Basil green,\nAnd why it flourish'd, as by magic touch;\nGreatly they wonder'd what the thing might mean:\nThey could not surely give belief, that such\nA very nothing would have power to wean\nHer from her own fair youth, and pleasures gay,\nAnd even remembrance of her love's delay.\nLIX.\nTherefore they watch'd a time when they might sift\nThis hidden whim; and long they watch'd in vain;\nFor seldom did she go to chapel-shrift,\nAnd seldom felt she any hunger-pain;\nAnd when she left, she hurried back, as swift\nAs bird on wing to breast its eggs again;\nAnd, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there\nBeside her Basil, weeping through her hair.\nLX.\nYet they contriv'd to steal the Basil-pot,\nAnd to examine it in secret place:\nThe thing was vile with green and livid spot,\nAnd yet they knew it was Lorenzo's face:\nThe guerdon of their murder they had got,\nAnd so left Florence in a moment's space,\nNever to turn again.\u2014Away they went,\nWith blood upon their heads, to banishment.\nLXI.\nO Melancholy, turn thine eyes away!\nO Music, Music, breathe despondingly!\nO Echo, Echo, on some other day,\nFrom isles Lethean, sigh to us\u2014O sigh!\nSpirits of grief, sing not your \"Well-a-way!\"\nFor Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die;\nWill die a death too lone and incomplete,\nNow they have ta'en away her Basil sweet.\nLXII.\nPiteous she look'd on dead and senseless things,\nAsking for her lost Basil amorously:\nAnd with melodious chuckle in the strings\nOf her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry\nAfter the Pilgrim in his wanderings,\nTo ask him where her Basil was; and why\n'Twas hid from her: \"For cruel 'tis,\" said she,\n\"To steal my Basil-pot away from me.\"\nLXIII.\nAnd so she pined, and so she died forlorn,\nImploring for her Basil to the last.\nNo heart was there in Florence but did mourn\nIn pity of her love, so overcast.\nAnd a sad ditty of this story born\nFrom mouth to mouth through all the country pass'd:\nStill is the burthen sung\u2014\"O cruelty,\n\"To steal my Basil-pot away from me!\"\n(stanza XXIV): Leigh Hunt cites the \"exquisite metaphor\" of lines 3 and 4 as an instance in which Keats \"over-informs the occasion or the speaker.\" But I doubt whether it is fair to class this kind of \"over-informing\" as an error. If poeple of this kind are to be denied one element of poetry, they must be denied another; and it is scarcely more strange to find the vile brethren of Isabella talking in metaphor than to find them talking in rhyme and metre. For the rest, a common-place Italian, even a villainous Italian, feels so intensely the sunlight of his land, that we need not object to the metaphor even on dramatic grounds.\n(stanza XXXIII): For Hinnom's Vale see Second Book of Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, Chapter XXVIII, verse 3: \"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.\"\n(stanza XLVIII): Hunt observes here - \"It is curious to see how the simple pathos of Boccaccio, or (which is the same thing) the simple intensity of the heroine's feelings, suffices our author more and more, as he gets to the end of his story. And he has related it as happily, as if he had never written any poetry but that of the heart.\"\n(stanza LIV): Whether the \"savage and tartarly\" assailants of Keats's day availed themselves of the word \"leafits\" in the 8th line for an accusation of word-coining, I do not know; but as far as I have been able to ascertain this diminutive of \"leaf\" is peculiar to the present passage.\n(stanza LXII): Hunt says - \"The passage about the tone of her voice, -- the poor lost-witted coaxing, -- the 'chuckle,' in which she asks after her Pilgrim and her Basil,-- is as true and touching an instance of the effect of a happy familiar word, as any in all poetry.\" It is difficult to imagine that these sentences of Hunt's were not somehow misprinted; but, as the review occurs only in the original issue of The Indicator, one has no means of testing this passage by comparison with later editions. It can hardly be supposed that Hunt really thought the Pilgrim meant Lorenzo; and it ought not to be necessary to explain that the poor lost girl called after any pilgrim whom chance sent her way, enquiring of him where her Basil was.\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

{"title": "D\u00e6monic Love", "author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "text": "Man was made of social earth,\nChild and brother from his birth;\nTethered by a liquid cord\nOf blood through veins of kindred poured,\nNext his heart the fireside band\nOf mother, father, sister, stand;\nNames from awful childhood heard,\nThrobs of a wild religion stirred,\nTheir good was heaven, their harm was vice,\nTill Beauty came to snap all ties,\nThe maid, abolishing the past,\nWith lotus-wine obliterates\nDear memory's stone-incarved traits,\nAnd by herself supplants alone\nFriends year by year more inly known.\nWhen her calm eyes opened bright,\nAll were foreign in their light.\nIt was ever the self-same tale,\nThe old experience will not fail,\u2014\nOnly two in the garden walked,\nAnd with snake and seraph talked.\nBut God said;\nI will have a purer gift,\nThere is smoke in the flame;\nNew flowerets bring, new prayers uplift,\nAnd love without a name.\nFond children, ye desire\nTo please each other well;\nAnother round, a higher,\nYe shall climb on the heavenly stair,\nAnd selfish preference forbear;\nAnd in right deserving,\nAnd without a swerving\nEach from your proper state,\nWeave roses for your mate.\nDeep, deep are loving eyes,\nFlowed with naphtha fiery sweet,\nAnd the point is Paradise\nWhere their glances meet:\nTheir reach shall yet be more profound,\nAnd a vision without bound:\nThe axis of those eyes sun-clear\nBe the axis of the sphere;\nThen shall the lights ye pour amain\nGo without check or intervals,\nThrough from the empyrean walls,\nUnto the same again.\nClose, close to men,\nLike undulating layer of air,\nRight above their heads,\nThe potent plain of D\u00e6mons spreads.\nStands to each human soul its own,\nFor watch, and ward, and furtherance\nIn the snares of nature's dance;\nAnd the lustre and the grace\nWhich fascinate each human heart,\nBeaming from another part,\nTranslucent through the mortal covers,\nIs the D\u00e6mon's form and face.\nTo and fro the Genius hies,\nA gleam which plays and hovers\nOver the maiden's head,\nAnd dips sometimes as low as to her eyes.\nUnknown, \u2014 albeit lying near, \u2014\nTo men the path to the D\u00e6mon sphere,\nAnd they that swiftly come and go,\nLeave no track on the heavenly snow.\nSometimes the airy synod bends,\nAnd the mighty choir descends,\nAnd the brains of men thenceforth,\nIn crowded and in still resorts,\nTeem with unwonted thoughts.\nAs when a shower of meteors\nCross the orbit of the earth,\nAnd, lit by fringent air,\nBlaze near and far.\nMortals deem the planets bright\nHave slipped their sacred bars,\nAnd the lone seaman all the night\nSails astonished amid stars.\nBeauty of a richer vein,\nGraces of a subtler strain,\nUnto men these moon-men lend,\nAnd our shrinking sky extend.\nSo is man's narrow path\nBy strength and terror skirted,\nAlso (from the song the wrath\nOf the Genii be averted!\nThe Muse the truth uncolored speaking),\nThe D\u00e6mons are self-seeking;\nTheir fierce and limitary will\nDraws men to their likeness still.\nThe erring painter made Love blind,\nHighest Love who shines on all;\nHim radiant, sharpest-sighted god\nNone can bewilder;\nWhose eyes pierce\nThe Universe,\nPath-finder, road-builder,\nMediator, royal giver,\nRightly-seeing, rightly-seen,\nOf joyful and transparent mien.\n'Tis a sparkle passing\nFrom each to each, from me to thee,\nPerpetually,\nSharing all, daring all,\nLevelling, misplacing\nEach obstruction, it unites\nEquals remote, and seeming opposites.\nAnd ever and forever Love\nDelights to build a road;\nUnheeded Danger near him strides,\nLove laughs, and on a lion rides.\nBut Cupid wears another face\nBorn into D\u00e6mons less divine,\nHis roses bleach apace,\nHis nectar smacks of wine.\nThe D\u00e6mon ever builds a wall,\nHimself incloses and includes,\nSolitude in solitudes:\nIn like sort his love doth fall.\nHe is an oligarch,\nHe prizes wonder, fame, and mark,\nHe loveth crowns,\nHe scorneth drones;\nHe doth elect\nThe beautiful and fortunate,\nAnd the sons of intellect,\nAnd the souls of ample fate,\nWho the Future's gates unbar,\nMinions of the Morning Star.\nIn his prowess he exults,\nAnd the multitude insults.\nHis impatient looks devour\nOft the humble and the poor,\nAnd, seeing his eye glare,\nThey drop their few pale flowers\nGathered with hope to please\nAlong the mountain towers,\nLose courage, and despair.\nHe will never be gainsaid,\nPitiless, will not be stayed.\nHis hot tyranny\nBurns up every other tie;\nTherefore comes an hour from Jove\nWhich his ruthless will defies,\nAnd the dogs of Fate unties.\nShiver the palaces of glass,\nShrivel the rainbow-colored walls\nWhere in bright art each god and sibyl dwelt\nSecure as in the Zodiack's belt;\nAnd the galleries and halls\nWherein every Siren sung,\nLike a meteor pass.\nFor this fortune wanted root\nIn the core of God's abysm,\nWas a weed of self and schism:\nAnd ever the D\u00e6monic Love\nIs the ancestor of wars,\nAnd the parent of remorse.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url":

{"title": "Initial Love", "author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "text": "Venus, when her son was lost,\nCried him up and down the coast,\nIn hamlets, palaces, and parks,\nAnd told the truant by his marks,\nGolden curls, and quiver, and bow;\u2014\nThis befell long ago.\nTime and tide are strangely changed,\nMen and manners much deranged;\nNone will now find Cupid latent\nBy this foolish antique patent.\nHe came late along the waste,\nShod like a traveller for haste,\nWith malice dared me to proclaim him,\nThat the maids and boys might name him.\nBoy no more, he wears all coats,\nFrocks, and blouses, capes, cap\u00f4tes,\nHe bears no bow, or quiver, or wand,\nNor chaplet on his head or hand:\nLeave his weeds and heed his eyes,\nAll the rest he can disguise.\nIn the pit of his eyes a spark\nWould bring back day if it were dark,\nAnd,\u2014if I tell you all my thought,\nThough I comprehend it not,\u2014\nIn those unfathomable orbs\nEvery function he absorbs;\nHe doth eat, and drink, and fish, and shoot,\nAnd ride, and run, and have, and hold,\nAnd whine, and flatter, and regret,\nAnd kiss, and couple, and beget,\nBy those roving eye-balls bold;\nUndaunted are their courages,\nRight Cossacks in their forages;\nFleeter they than any creature,\nThey are his steeds and not his feature,\nInquisitive, and fierce, and fasting,\nRestless, predatory, hasting,\u2014\nAnd they pounce on other eyes,\nAs lions on their prey;\nAnd round their circles is writ,\nPlainer than the day,\nUnderneath, within, above,\nLove, love, love, love.\nHe lives in his eyes,\nThere doth digest, and work, and spin,\nAnd buy, and sell, and lose, and win;\nHe rolls them with delighted motion,\nJoy-tides swell their mimic ocean.\nYet holds he them with tortest rein,\nThat they may seize and entertain\nThe glance that to their glance opposes,\nLike fiery honey sucked from roses.\nHe palmistry can understand,\nImbibing virtue by his hand\nAs if it were a living root;\nThe pulse of hands will make him mute;\nWith all his force he gathers balms\nInto those wise thrilling palms.\nCupid is a casuist,\nA mystic, and a cabalist,\nCan your lurking Thought surprise,\nAnd interpret your device;\nMainly versed in occult science,\nIn magic, and in clairvoyance.\nOft he keeps his fine ear strained,\nAnd reason on her tiptoe pained,\nFor aery intelligence,\nAnd for strange coincidence.\nBut it touches his quick heart\nWhen Fate by omens takes his part,\nAnd chance-dropt hints from Nature's sphere\nDeeply soothe his anxious ear.\nHeralds high before him run,\nHe has ushers many a one,\nSpreads his welcome where he goes,\nAnd touches all things with his rose.\nAll things wait for and divine him,\u2014\nHow shall I dare to malign him,\nOr accuse the god of sport?\u2014\nI must end my true report,\nPainting him from head to foot,\nIn as far as I took note,\nTrusting well the matchless power\nOf this young-eyed emperor\nWill clear his fame from every cloud,\nWith the bards, and with the crowd.\nHe is wilful, mutable,\nShy, untamed, inscrutable,\nSwifter-fashioned than the fairies,\nSubstance mixed of pure contraries,\nHis vice some elder virtue's token,\nAnd his good is evil spoken.\nFailing sometimes of his own,\nHe is headstrong and alone;\nHe affects the wood and wild,\nLike a flower-hunting child,\nBuries himself in summer waves,\nIn trees, with beasts, in mines, and caves,\nLoves nature like a horned cow,\nBird, or deer, or cariboo.\nShun him, nymphs, on the fleet horses!\nHe has a total world of wit,\nO how wise are his discourses!\nBut he is the arch-hypocrite,\nAnd through all science and all art,\nSeeks alone his counterpart.\nHe is a Pundit of the east,\nHe is an augur and a priest,\nAnd his soul will melt in prayer,\nBut word and wisdom are a snare;\nCorrupted by the present toy,\nThere is no mask but he will wear,\nHe invented oaths to swear,\nHe paints, he carves, he chants, he prays,\nAnd holds all stars in his embrace,\nGodlike, \u2014but 'tis for his fine pelf,\nThe social quintessence of self.\nWell, said I, he is hypocrite,\nAnd folly the end of his subtle wit,\nHe takes a sovran privilege\nNot allowed to any liege,\nFor he does go behind all law,\nAnd right into himself does draw,\nFor he is sovranly allied.\nHeaven's oldest blood flows in his side,\nAnd interchangeably at one\nWith every king on every throne,\nThat no God dare say him nay,\nOr see the fault, or seen betray;\nHe has the Muses by the heart,\nAnd the Parc\u00e6 all are of his part.\nHis many signs cannot be told,\nHe has not one mode, but manifold,\nMany fashions and addresses,\nPiques, reproaches, hurts, caresses,\nAction, service, badinage,\nHe will preach like a friar,\nAnd jump like Harlequin,\nHe will read like a crier,\nAnd fight like a Paladin.\nBoundless is his memory,\nPlans immense his term prolong,\nHe is not of counted age,\nMeaning always to be young.\nAnd his wish is intimacy,\nIntimater intimacy,\nAnd a stricter privacy,\nThe impossible shall yet be done,\nAnd being two shall still be one.\nAs the wave breaks to foam on shelves,\nThen runs into a wave again,\nSo

She lived her whole\nLife long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.\nI'll show You how she had her sills extended\nTo entertain the birds and hold the flowers.\nOur business first's up attic with her books.'\nWe trod uncomfortably on crunching glass\nThrough a house stripped of everything\nBooks, I should say!- if books are what is needed.\nA whole edition in a packing case\nThat, overflowing like a horn of plenty,\nOr like the poetess's heart of love,\nHad spilled them near the window, toward the light\nWhere driven rain had wet and swollen them.\nEnough to stock a village library-\nUnfortunately all of one kind, though.\nAnd taken thus into the family.\nBoys and bad hunters had known what to do\nWith stone and lead to unprotected glass:\nShatter it inward on the unswept floors.\nHow had the tender verse escaped their outrage?\nBy being invisible for what it was,\nOr else by some remoteness that defied them\nTo find out what to do to hurt a poem.\nYet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,\nTo send it sailing out the attic window\nTill it caught wind and, opening out its covers,\nTried to improve on sailing like a tile\nBy flying like a bird (silent in flight,\nBut all the burden of its body song),\nOnly to tumble like a stricken bird,\nAnd lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.\nBooks were not thrown irreverently about.\nThey simply lay where someone now and then,\nHaving tried one, had dropped it at his feet\nAnd left it lying where it fell rejected.\nHere were all those the poetess's life\nHad been too short to sell or give away.\n'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.\n'Why not take two or three?'\n'Take all you want.'\nGood-looking books like that.' He picked one fresh\nIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,\nAnd stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.\nHe read in one and I read in another,\nBoth either looking for or finding something.\nThe attic wasps went missing by like bullets.\nI was soon satisfied for the time being.\nAll the way home I kept remembering\nThe small book in my pocket. It was there.\nThe poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven\nAt having eased her heart of one more copy-\nLegitimately. My demand upon her,\nThough slight, was a demand.

{"title": "A Servant To Servants", "author": "Robert Frost", "text": "I didn't make you know how glad I was\nTo have you come and camp here on our land.\nI promised myself to get down some day\nAnd see the way you lived, but I don't know!\nWith a houseful of hungry men to feed\nI guess you'd find\u2026. It seems to me\nI can't express my feelings any more\nThan I can raise my voice or want to lift\nMy hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).\nDid ever you feel so? I hope you never.\nIt's got so I don't even know for sure\nWhether I am glad, sorry, or anything.\nThere's nothing but a voice-like left inside\nThat seems to tell me how I ought to feel,\nAnd would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.\nYou take the lake. I look and look at it.\nI see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.\nI stand and make myself repeat out loud\nThe advantages it has, so long and narrow,\nLike a deep piece of some old running river\nCut short off at both ends. It lies five miles\nStraight away through the mountain notch\nFrom the sink window where I wash the plates,\nAnd all our storms come up toward the house,\nDrawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.\nIt took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit\nTo step outdoors and take the water dazzle\nA sunny morning, or take the rising wind\nAbout my face and body and through my wrapper,\nWhen a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,\nAnd a cold chill shivered across the lake.\nI see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,\nOur Willoughby! How did you hear of it?\nI expect, though, everyone's heard of it.\nIn a book about ferns? Listen to that!\nYou let things more like feathers regulate\nYour going and coming. And you like it here?\nI can see how you might. But I don't know!\nIt would be different if more people came,\nFor then there would be business. As it is,\nThe cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,\nSometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore\nThat ought to be worth something, and may yet.\nBut I don't count on it as much as Len.\nHe looks on the bright side of everything,\nIncluding me. He thinks I'll be all right\nWith doctoring. But it's not medicine\u2014\nLowe is the only doctor's dared to say so\u2014\nIt's rest I want\u2014there, I have said it out\u2014\nFrom cooking meals for hungry hired men\nAnd washing dishes after them\u2014from doing\nThings over and over that just won't stay done.\nBy good rights I ought not to have so much\nPut on me, but there seems no other way.\nLen says one steady pull more ought to do it.\nHe says the best way out is always through.\nAnd I agree to that, or in so far\nAs that I can see no way out but through\u2014\nLeastways for me\u2014and then they'll be convinced.\nIt's not that Len don't want the best for me.\nIt was his plan our moving over in\nBeside the lake from where that day I showed you\nWe used to live\u2014ten miles from anywhere.\nWe didn't change without some sacrifice,\nBut Len went at it to make up the loss.\nHis work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,\nBut he works when he works as hard as I do\u2014\nThough there's small profit in comparisons.\n(Women and men will make them all the same.)\nBut work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.\nHe's into everything in town. This year\nIt's highways, and he's got too many men\nAround him to look after that make waste.\nThey take advantage of him shamefully,\nAnd proud, too, of themselves for doing so.\nWe have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,\nSprawling about the kitchen with their talk\nWhile I fry their bacon. Much they care!\nNo more put out in what they do or say\nThan if I wasn't in the room at all.\nComing and going all the time, they are:\nI don't learn what their names are, let alone\nTheir characters, or whether they are safe\nTo have inside the house with doors unlocked.\nI'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not\nAfraid of me. There's two can play at that.\nI have my fancies: it runs in the family.\nMy father's brother wasn't right. They kept him\nLocked up for years back there at the old farm.\nI've been away once\u2014yes, I've been away.\nThe State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\nI wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;\nYou know the old idea\u2014the only asylum\nWas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\nRather than send their folks to such a place,\nKept them at home; and it does seem more human.\nBut it's not so: the place is the asylum.\nThere they have every means proper to do with,\nAnd you aren't darkening other people's lives\u2014\nWorse than no good to them, and they no good\nTo you in your condition; you can't know\nAffection or the want of it in that state.\nI've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\nMy father's brother, he went mad quite young.\nSome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\nBecause his violence took on the form\nOf carrying his pillow in his teeth;\nBut it's more likely he was crossed in love,\nOr so the story goes. It was some girl.\nAnyway all he talked about was love.\nThey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\nIf he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended\nIn father's building him a sort of cage,\nOr room within a room, of hickory poles,\nLike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,\u2014\nA narrow passage all the way around.\nAnything they put in for furniture\nHe'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\nSo they made the place comfortable with straw,\nLike a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.\nOf course they had to feed him without dishes.\nThey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\nWith his clothes on his arm\u2014all of his clothes.\nCruel\u2014it sounds. I 'spose they did the best\nThey knew. And just when he was at the height,\nFather and mother married, and mother came,\nAnd accommodate her young life to his.\nThat was what marrying father meant to her.\nShe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\nBy his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout\nUntil the strength was shouted out of him,\nAnd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\nHe'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\nAnd let them go and make them twang until\nHis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\nAnd then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play\u2014\nThe only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,\nThey found a way to put a stop to it.\nHe was before my time\u2014I never saw him;\nBut the pen stayed exactly as it was\nThere in the upper chamber in the ell,\nA sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\nI often think of the smooth hickory bars.\nIt got so I would say\u2014you know, half fooling\u2014\n\"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail\"\u2014\nJust as you will till it becomes a habit.\nNo wonder I was glad to get away.\nMind you, I waited till Len said the word.\nI didn't want the blame if things went wrong.\nI was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\nAnd I looked to be happy, and I was,\nAs I said, for a while\u2014but I don't know!\nSomehow the change wore out like a prescription.\nAnd there's more to it than just window-views\nUnless Len took the notion, which he won't,\nAnd I won't ask him\u2014it's not sure enough.\nI 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:\nOther folks have to, and why shouldn't I?\nI almost think if I could do like you,\nDrop everything and live out on the ground\u2014\nBut it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,\nOr a long rain. I should soon get enough,\nAnd be glad of a good roof overhead.\nI've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,\nMore than you have yourself, some of these nights.\nThe wonder was the tents weren't snatched away\nFrom over you as you lay in your beds.\nI haven't courage for a risk like that.\nBless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,\nBut the thing of it is, I need to be kept.\nThere's work enough to do\u2014there's always that;\nBut behind's behind. The worst that you can do\nIs set me back a little more behind.\nI sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway.\nI'd rather you'd not go unless you must.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/A-Servant-To-Servants"}

He learned all there was\nTo learn about not launching out too soon\nAnd so not carrying the tree away\nClear to the ground. He always kept his poise\nTo the top branches, climbing carefully\nWith the same pains you use to fill a cup\nUp to the brim, and even above the brim.\nThen he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\nKicking his way down through the air to the ground.\nSo was I once myself a swinger of birches.\nAnd so I dream of going back to be.\nIt's when I'm weary of considerations,\nAnd life is too much like a pathless wood\nWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\nBroken across it, and one eye is weeping\nFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.\nI'd like to get away from earth awhile\nAnd then come back to it and begin over.\nMay no fate willfully misunderstand me\nAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me away\nNot to return.

Out of labor came villages\nAnd the towns that grew cities.\nLabor! Out of labor came the rowboats\nAnd the sailboats and the steamboats,\nCame the wagons, and the coaches,\nCovered wagons, stage coaches,\nOut of labor came the factories,\nCame the foundries, came the railroads.\nCame the mighty products moulded, manufactured,\nSold in shops, piled in warehouses,\nShipped the wide world over:\nOut of labor-white hands and black hands-\nCame the dream, the strength, the will,\nAnd the way to build America.\nNow it is Me here, and You there.\nNow it\u2019s Manhattan, Chicago,\nSeattle, New Orleans,\nBoston and El Paso-\nNow it\u2019s the U.S.A.\nA long time ago, but not too long ago, a man said:\nALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL\u2014\nENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR\nWITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS\u2014\nAMONG THESE LIFE, LIBERTY\nAND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.\nHis name was Jefferson. There were slaves then,\nBut in their hearts the slaves believed him, too,\nAnd silently too for granted\nThat what he said was also meant for them.\nIt was a long time ago,\nBut not so long ago at that, Lincoln said:\nNO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH\nTO GOVERN ANOTHER MAN\nWITHOUT THAT OTHER\u2019S CONSENT.\nThere were slaves then, too,\nBut in their hearts the slaves knew\nWhat he said must be meant for every human being-\nElse it had no meaning for anyone.\nThen a man said:\nBETTER TO DIE FREE\nTHAN TO LIVE SLAVES\nHe was a colored man who had been a slave\nBut had run away to freedom.\nAnd the slaves knew\nWhat Frederick Douglass said was true.\nWith John Brown at Harper\u2019s Ferry, Negroes died.\nJohn Brown was hung.\nBefore the Civil War, days were dark,\nAnd nobody knew for sure\nWhen freedom would triumph\n\"Or if it would,\" thought some.\nBut others new it had to triumph.\nIn those dark days of slavery,\nGuarding in their hearts the seed of freedom,\nThe slaves made up a song:\nKeep Your Hand On The Plow! Hold On!\nThat song meant just what it said: Hold On!\nFreedom will come!\nKeep Your Hand On The Plow! Hold On!\nOut of war it came, bloody and terrible!\nBut it came!\nSome there were, as always,\nWho doubted that the war would end right,\nThat the slaves would be free,\nOr that the union would stand,\nBut now we know how it all came out.\nOut of the darkest days for people and a nation,\nWe know now how it came out.\nThere was light when the battle clouds rolled away.\nThere was a great wooded land,\nAnd men united as a nation.\nAmerica is a dream.\nThe poet says it was promises.\nThe people say it is promises-that will come true.\nThe people do not always say things out loud,\nThe people often hold\nGreat thoughts in their deepest hearts\nAnd sometimes only blunderingly express them,\nHaltingly and stumblingly say them,\nAnd faultily put them into practice.\nThe people do not always understand each other.\nBut there is, somewhere there,\nAlways the trying to understand,\nAnd the trying to say,\n\"You are a man. Together we are building our land.\"\nAmerica!\nLand created in common,\nDream nourished in common,\nKeep your hand on the plow! Hold on!\nIf the house is not yet finished,\nDon\u2019t be discouraged, builder!\nIf the fight is not yet won,\nDon\u2019t be weary, soldier!\nThe plan and the pattern is here,\nWoven from the beginning\nInto the warp and woof of America:\nALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.\nNO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH\nTO GOVERN ANOTHER MAN\nWITHOUT HIS CONSENT.\nBETTER DIE FREE,\nTHAN TO LIVE SLAVES.\nWho said those things? Americans!\nWho owns those words? America!\nWho is America? You, me!\nWe are America!\nTo the enemy who would conquer us from without,\nWe say, NO!\nTo the enemy who would divide\nAnd conquer us from within,\nWe say, NO!\nFREEDOM!\nBROTHERHOOD!\nDEMOCRACY!\nTo all the enemies of these great words:\nWe say, NO!\nA long time ago,\nAn enslaved people heading toward freedom\nMade up a song:\nKeep Your Hand On The Plow! Hold On!\nThe plow plowed a new furrow\nAcross the field of history.\nInto that furrow the freedom seed was dropped.\nFrom that seed a tree grew, is growing, will ever grow.\nThat tree is for everybody,\nFor all America, for all the world.\nMay its branches spread and shelter grow\nUntil all races and all peoples know its shade.\nKEEP YOUR HAND ON THE PLOW!

'Twas such an eve\nWhen first her soul began indeed to grieve:\nThen he was here; now he is very far.\nThe sweetness of the balmy evening\nA sorrow o'er her aged soul did fling,\nYet not devoid of rapture\u2019s mingled tear:\nA balm was in the poison of the sting.\nThis aged sufferer for many a year\nHad never felt such comfort. She suppressed\nA sigh--and turning round, clasped William to her breast!\nAnd, though his form was wasted by the woe\nWhich tyrants on their victims love to wreak,\nThough his sunk eyeballs and his faded cheek\nOf slavery's violence and scorn did speak,\nYet did the aged woman's bosom glow.\nThe vital fire seemed re-illumed within\nBy this sweet unexpected welcoming.\nOh, consummation of the fondest hope\nThat ever soared on Fancy's wildest wing!\nOh, tenderness that foundst so sweet a scope!\nPrince who dost pride thee on thy mighty sway,\nWhen THOU canst feel such love, thou shalt be great as they!\nVI.\nHer son, compelled, the country's foes had fought,\nHad bled in battle; and the stern control\nWhich ruled his sinews and coerced his soul\nUtterly poisoned life's unmingled bowl,\nAnd unsubduable evils on him brought.\nHe was the shadow of the lusty child\nWho, when the time of summer season smiled,\nDid earn for her a meal of honesty,\nAnd with affectionate discourse beguiled\nThe keen attacks of pain and poverty;\nTill Power, as envying her this only joy,\nFrom her maternal bosom tore the unhappy boy.\nVII.\nAnd now cold charity's unwelcome dole\nWas insufficient to support the pair;\nAnd they would perish rather than would bear\nThe law's stern slavery, and the insolent stare\nWith which law loves to rend the poor man's soul--\nThe bitter scorn, the spirit-sinking noise\nOf heartless mirth which women, men, and boys\nWake in this scene of legal misery.\n...\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/A-Tale-Of-Society-As-It-Is:-From-Facts,-1811"}
{"title": "A Vision Of The Sea", "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "text": "'Tis the terror of tempest. The rags of the sail\nAre flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale:\nFrom the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven,\nAnd when lightning is loosed, like a deluge from Heaven,\nShe sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin\nAnd bend, as if Heaven was ruining in,\nWhich they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass\nAs if ocean had sunk from beneath them: they pass\nTo their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound,\nAnd the waves and the thunders, made silent around,\nLeave the wind to its echo. The vessel, now tossed\nThrough the low-trailing rack of the tempest, is lost\nIn the skirts of the thunder-cloud: now down the sweep\nOf the wind-cloven wave to the chasm of the deep\nIt sinks, and the walls of the watery vale\nWhose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale,\nDim mirrors of ruin, hang gleaming about;\nWhile the surf, like a chaos of stars, like a rout\nOf death-flames, like whirlpools of fire-flowing iron,\nWith splendour and terror the black ship environ,\nOr like sulphur-flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire\nIn fountains spout o\u2019er it. In many a spire\nThe pyramid-billows with white points of brine\nIn the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine,\nAs piercing the sky from the floor of the sea.\nThe great ship seems splitting! it cracks as a tree,\nWhile an earthquake is splintering its root, ere the blast\nOf the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed.\nThe intense thunder-balls which are raining from Heaven\nHave shattered its mast, and it stands black and riven.\nThe chinks suck destruction. The heavy dead hulk\nOn the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk,\nLike a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold\nIts corruption around it. Meanwhile, from the hold,\nOne deck is burst up by the waters below,\nAnd it splits like the ice when the thaw-breezes blow\nO\u2019er the lakes of the desert! Who sit on the other?\nIs that all the crew that lie burying each other,\nLike the dead in a breach, round the foremast? Are those\nTwin tigers, who burst, when the waters arose,\nIn the agony of terror, their chains in the hold;\n(What now makes them tame, is what then made them bold);\nWho crouch, side by side, and have driven, like a crank,\nThe deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank\nAre these all? Nine weeks the tall vessel had lain\nOn the windless expanse of the watery plain,\nWhere the death-darting sun cast no shadow at noon,\nAnd there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon,\nTill a lead-coloured fog gathered up from the deep,\nWhose breath was quick pestilence; then, the cold sleep\nCrept, like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn,\nO\u2019er the populous vessel. And even and morn,\nWith their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast\nLike dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast\nDown the deep, which closed on them above and around,\nAnd the sharks and the dogfish their grave-clothes unbound,\nAnd were glutted like Jews with this manna rained down\nFrom God on their wilderness. One after one\nThe mariners died; on the eve of this day,\nWhen the tempest was gathering in cloudy array,\nBut seven remained. Six the thunder has smitten,\nAnd they lie black as mummies on which Time has written\nHis scorn of the embalmer; the seventh, from the deck\nAn oak-splinter pierced through his breast and his back,\nAnd hung out to the tempest, a wreck on the wreck.\nNo more? At the helm sits a woman more fair\nThan Heaven, when, unbinding its star-braided hair,\nIt sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea.\nShe clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee;\nIt laughs at the lightning, it mocks the mixed thunder\nOf the air and the sea, with desire and with wonder\nIt is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near,\nIt would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear\nIs outshining the meteors; its bosom beats high,\nThe heart-fire of pleasure has kindled its eye,\nWhile its mother\u2019s is lustreless. \u2018Smile not, my child,\nBut sleep deeply and sweetly, and so be beguiled\nOf the pang that awaits us, whatever that be,\nSo dreadful since thou must divide it with me!\nDream, sleep! This pale bosom, thy cradle and bed,\nWill it rock thee not, infant? \u2019Tis beating with dread!\nAlas! what is life, what is death, what are we,\nThat when the ship sinks we no longer may be?\nWhat! to see thee no more, and to feel thee no more?\nTo be after life what we have been before?\nNot to touch those sweet hands? Not to look on those eyes,\nThose lips, and that hair,\u2014all the smiling disguise\nThou yet wearest, sweet Spirit, which I, day by day,\nHave so long called my child, but which now fades away\nLike a rainbow, and I the fallen shower?\u2019\u2014Lo! the ship\nIs settling, it topples, the leeward ports dip;\nThe tigers leap up when they feel the slow brine\nCrawling inch by inch on them; hair, ears, limbs, and eyne,\nStand rigid with horror; a loud, long, hoarse cry\nBursts at once from their vitals tremendously,\nAnd \u2019tis borne down the mountainous vale of the wave,\nRebounding, like thunder, from crag to cave,\nMixed with the clash of the lashing rain,\nHurried on by the might of the hurricane:\nThe hurricane came from the west, and passed on\nBy the path of the gate of the eastern sun,\nTransversely dividing the stream of the storm;\nAs an arrowy serpent, pursuing the form\nOf an elephant, bursts through the brakes of the waste.\nBlack as a cormorant the screaming blast,\nBetween Ocean and Heaven, like an ocean, passed,\nTill it came to the clouds on the verge of the world\nWhich, based on the sea and to Heaven upcurled,\nLike columns and walls did surround and sustain\nThe dome of the tempest; it rent them in twain,\nAs a flood rends its barriers of mountainous crag:\nAnd the dense clouds in many a ruin and rag,\nLike the stones of a temple ere earthquake has passed,\nLike the dust of its fall. on the whirlwind are cast;\nThey are scattered like foam on the torrent; and where\nThe wind has burst out through the chasm, from the air\nOf clear morning the beams of the sunrise flow in,\nUnimpeded, keen, golden, and crystalline,\nBanded armies of light and of air; at one gate\nThey encounter, but interpenetrate.\nAnd that breach in the tempest is widening away,\nAnd the caverns of cloud are torn up by the day,\nAnd the fierce winds are sinking with weary wings,\nLulled by the motion and murmurings\nAnd the long glassy heave of the rocking sea,\nAnd overhead glorious, but dreadful to see,\nThe wrecks of the tempest, like vapours of gold,\nAre consuming in sunrise. The heaped waves behold\nThe deep calm of blue Heaven dilating above,\nAnd, like passions made still by the presence of Love,\nBeneath the clear surface reflecting it slide\nTremulous with soft influence; extending its tide\nFrom the Andes to Atlas, round mountain and isle,\nRound sea-birds and wrecks, paved with Heaven\u2019s azure smile,\nThe wide world of waters is vibrating. Where\nIs the ship? On the verge of the wave where it lay\nOne tiger is mingled in ghastly affray\nWith a sea-snake. The foam and the smoke of the battle\nStain the clear air with sunbows; the jar, and the rattle\nOf solid bones crushed by the infinite stress\nOf the snake\u2019s adamantine voluminousness;\nAnd the hum of the hot blood that spouts and rains\nWhere the gripe of the tiger has wounded the veins\nSwollen with rage, strength, and effort; the whirl and the splash\nAs of some hideous engine whose brazen teeth smash\nThe thin winds and soft waves into thunder; the screams\nAnd hissings crawl fast o'er the smooth ocean-streams,\nEach sound like a centipede. Near this commotion,\nA blue shark is hanging within the blue ocean,\nThe fin-winged tomb of the victor. The other\nIs winning his way from the fate of his brother\nTo his own with the speed of despair. Lo! a boat\nAdvances; twelve rowers with the impulse of thought\nUrge on the keen keel,\u2014the brine foams. At the stern\nThree marksmen stand levelling. Hot bullets burn\nIn the breast of the tiger, which yet bears him on\nTo his refuge and ruin. One fragment alone,--\n\u2019Tis dwindling and sinking, \u2019tis now almost gone,--\nOf the wreck of the vessel peers out of the sea.\nWith her left hand she grasps it impetuously.\nWith her right she sustains her fair infant. Death, Fear,\nLove, Beauty, are mixed in the atmosphere,\nWhich trembles and burns with the fervour of dread\nAround her wild eyes, her bright hand, and her head,\nLike a meteor of light o\u2019er the waters! her child\nIs yet smiling, and playing, and murmuring; so smiled\nThe false deep ere the storm. Like a sister and brother\nThe child and the ocean still smile on each other,\nWhilst\u2014\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/A-Vision-Of-The-Sea"}

Poor Archy, whose owl-eyes are tempered to the error of his age, and because he is a fool, and by special ordinance of God forbidden ever to see himself as he is, sees now in that deep eye a blindfold devil sitting on the ball, and weighing words out between king and subjects.

The uttermost\nFarthing exact from those who claim exemption\nFrom knighthood: that which once was a reward\nShall thus be made a punishment, that subjects\nMay know how majesty can wear at will\nThe rugged mood.\u2014My Lord of Coventry,\nLay my command upon the Courts below\nThat bail be not accepted for the prisoners\nUnder the warrant of the Star Chamber.\nThe people shall not find the stubbornness\nOf Parliament a cheap or easy method\nOf dealing with their rightful sovereign:\nAnd doubt not this, my Lord of Coventry,\nWe will find time and place for fit rebuke.\u2014\nMy Lord of Canterbury.\nArchy.\nThe fool is here.\nLaud.\nI crave permission of your Majesty\nTo order that this insolent fellow be\nChastised: he mocks the sacred character,\nScoffs at the state, and--\nKing.\nWhat, my Archy?\nHe mocks and mimics all he sees and hears,\nYet with a quaint and graceful licence\u2014Prithee\nFor this once do not as Prynne would, were he\nPrimate of England. With your Grace's leave,\nHe lives in his own world; and, like a parrot\nHung in his gilded prison from the window\nOf a queen's bower over the public way,\nBlasphemes with a bird's mind:\u2014his words, like arrows\nWhich know no aim beyond the archer's wit,\nStrike sometimes what eludes philosophy.\u2014\n(To Archy.)\nGo, sirrah, and repent of your offence\nTen minutes in the rain; be it your penance\nTo bring news how the world goes there.\n[Exit Archy.\nPoor Archy!\nHe weaves about himself a world of mirth\nOut of the wreck of ours.\nLaud.\nI take with patience, as my Master did,\nAll scoffs permitted from above.\nKing.\nMy lord,\nPray overlook these papers.

My dearest lord,\nI see the new-born courage in your eye\nArmed to strike dead the Spirit of the Time,\nWhich spurs to rage the many-headed beast.\nDo thou persist: for, faint but in resolve,\nAnd it were better thou hadst still remained\nThe slave of thine own slaves, who tear like curs\nThe fugitive, and flee from the pursuer;\nAnd Opportunity, that empty wolf,\nFlies at his throat who falls. Subdue thy actions\nEven to the disposition of thy purpose,\nAnd be that tempered as the Ebro's steel;\nAnd banish weak-eyed Mercy to the weak,\nWhence she will greet thee with a gift of peace,\nAnd not betray thee with a traitor's kiss,\nAs when she keeps the company of rebels,\nWho think that she is Fear.

Degree and form,\nAnd all that makes the age of reasoning man\nMore memorable than a beast's, depend on this--\nThat Right should fence itself inviolably\nWith Power; in which respect the state of England\nFrom usurpation by the insolent commons\nCries for reform.\nGet treason, and spare treasure. Fee with coin\nThe loudest murmurers; feed with jealousies\nOpposing factions,-- be thyself of none;\nAnd borrow gold of many, for those who lend\nWill serve thee till thou payest them; and thus\nKeep the fierce spirit of the hour at bay,\nTill time, and its coming generations\nOf nights and days unborn, bring some one chance,...\nOr war or pestilence or Nature's self,--\nBy some distemperature or terrible sign,\nBe as an arbiter betwixt themselves.\n...Nor let your Majesty\nDoubt here the peril of the unseen event.\nHow did your brother Kings, coheritors\nIn your high interest in the subject earth,\nRise past such troubles to that height of power\nWhere now they sit, and awfully serene\nSmile on the trembling world? Such popular storms\nPhilip the Second of Spain, this Lewis of France,\nAnd late the German head of many bodies,\nAnd every petty lord of Italy,\nQuelled or by arts or arms.

Mark the consequence of warming\nThis brood of northern vipers in your bosom.\nThe rabble, instructed no doubt\nBy Loudon, Lindsay, Hume, and false Argyll\n(For the waves never menace heaven until\nScourged by the wind's invisible tyranny),\nHave in the very temple of the Lord\nDone outrage to His chosen ministers.\nThey scorn the liturgy of the Holy Church,\nRefuse to obey her canons, and deny\nThe apostolic power with which the Spirit\nHas filled its elect vessels, even from him\nWho held the keys with power to loose and bind,\nTo him who now pleads in this royal presence.\u2014\nLet ample powers and new instructions be\nSent to the High Commissioners in Scotland.\nTo death, imprisonment, and confiscation,\nAdd torture, add the ruin of the kindred\nOf the offender, add the brand of infamy,\nAdd mutilation: and if this suffice not,\nUnleash the sword and fire, that in their thirst\nThey may lick up that scum of schismatics.\nI laugh at those weak rebels who, desiring\nWhat we possess, still prate of Christian peace,\nAs if those dreadful arbitrating messengers\nWhich play the part of God 'twixt right and wrong,\nShould be let loose against the innocent sleep\nOf templed cities and the smiling fields,\nFor some poor argument of policy\nWhich touches our own profit or our pride\n(Where it indeed were Christian charity\nTo turn the cheek even to the smiter's hand):\nAnd, when our great Redeemer, when our God,\nWhen He who gave, accepted, and retained\nHimself in propitiation of our sins,\nIs scorned in His immediate ministry,\nWith hazard of the inestimable loss\nOf all the truth and discipline which is\nSalvation to the extremest generation\nOf men innumerable, they talk of peace!\nSuch peace as Canaan found, let Scotland now:\nFor, by that Christ who came to bring a sword,\nNot peace, upon the earth, and gave command\nTo His disciples at the Passover\nThat each should sell his robe and buy a sword,\u2014\nOnce strip that minister of naked wrath,\nAnd it shall never sleep in peace again\nTill Scotland bend or break.\nKing.\nMy Lord Archbishop,\nDo what thou wilt and what thou canst in this.\nThy earthly even as thy heavenly King\nGives thee large power in his unquiet realm.\nBut we want money, and my mind misgives me\nThat for so great an enterprise, as yet,\nWe are unfurnished.\nStrafford.\nYet it may not long\nRest on our wills.\nCottington.\nThe expenses\nOf gathering shipmoney, and of distraining\nFor every petty rate (for we encounter\nA desperate opposition inch by inch\nIn every warehouse and on every farm),\nHave swallowed up the gross sum of the imposts;\nSo that, though felt as a most grievous scourge\nUpon the land, they stand us in small stead\nAs touches the receipt.\nStrafford.\n'Tis a conclusion\nMost arithmetical: and thence you infer\nPerhaps the assembling of a parliament.\nNow, if a man should call his dearest enemies\nTo sit in licensed judgement on his life,\nHis Majesty might wisely take that course. [Aside to Cottington.\nIt is enough to expect from these lean imposts\nThat they perform the office of a scourge,\nWithout more profit. (Aloud.)\nFines and confiscations,\nAnd a forced loan from the refractory city,\nWill fill our coffers: and the golden love\nOf loyal gentlemen and noble friends\nFor the worshipped father of our common country,\nWith contributions from the catholics,\nWill make Rebellion pale in our excess.\nBe these the expedients until time and wisdom\nShall frame a settled state of government.\nLaud.\nAnd weak expedients they!

{"title": "Epipsychidion", "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "text": "VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE NOBLE AND UNFORTUNATE LADY, EMILIA V---,\nNOW IMPRISONED IN THE CONVENT OF ---\nL'anima amante si slancia fuori del creato, e si crea nell' infinito un Mondo tutto per essa, diverso assai da questo oscuro e pauroso baratro.\n~Her own words.\nMy Song, I fear that thou wilt find but few\nWho fitly shall conceive thy reasoning,\nOf such hard matter dost thou entertain;\nWhence, if by misadventure, chance should bring\nThee to base company (as chance may do),\nQuite unaware of what thou dost contain,\nI prithee, comfort thy sweet self again,\nMy last delight! tell them that they are dull,\nAnd bid them own that thou art beautiful.\nEPIPSYCHIDION.\nSweet Spirit! Sister of that orphan one,\nWhose empire is the name thou weepest on,\nIn my heart's temple I suspend to thee\nThese votive wreaths of withered memory.\nPoor captive bird! who, from thy narrow cage,\nPourest such music, that it might assuage\nThe rugg\u00e8d hearts of those who prisoned thee,\nWere they not deaf to all sweet melody;\nThis song shall be thy rose: its petals pale\nAre dead, indeed, my adored Nightingale!\nBut soft and fragrant is the faded blossom,\nAnd it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom.\nHigh, spirit-wing\u00e8d Heart! who dost for ever\nBeat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour,\nTill those bright plumes of thought, in which arrayed\nIt over-soared this low and worldly shade,\nLie shattered; and thy panting, wounded breast\nStains with dear blood its unmaternal nest!\nI weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be,\nYet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee.\nSeraph of Heaven! too gentle to be human,\nVeiling beneath that radiant form of Woman\nAll that is insupportable in thee\nOf light, and love, and immortality!\nSweet Benediction in the eternal Curse!\nVeiled Glory of this lampless Universe!\nThou Moon beyond the clouds! Thou living Form\nAmong the Dead! Thou Star above the Storm!\nThou Wonder, and thou Beauty, and thou Terror!\nThou Harmony of Nature's art! Thou Mirror\nIn whom, as in the splendour of the Sun,\nAll shapes look glorious which thou gazest on!\nAy, even the dim words which obscure thee now\nFlash, lightning-like, with unaccustomed glow;\nI pray thee that thou blot from this sad song\nAll of its much mortality and wrong,\nWith those clear drops, which start like sacred dew\nFrom the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through,\nWeeping, till sorrow becomes ecstasy:\nThen smile on it, so that it may not die.\nI never thought before my death to see\nYouth's vision thus made perfect. Emily,\nI love thee; though the world by no thin name\nWill hide that love from its unvalued shame.\nWould we two had been twins of the same mother!\nOr, that the name my heart lent to another\nCould be a sister's bond for her and thee,\nBlending two beams of one eternity!\nYet were one lawful and the other true,\nThese names, though dear, could paint not, as is due,\nHow beyond refuge I am thine. Ah me!\nI am not thine: I am a part of thee.\nSweet Lamp! my moth-like Muse has burned its wings\nOr, like a dying swan who soars and sings,\nYoung Love should teach Time, in his own gray style,\nAll that thou art. Art thou not void of guile,\nA lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless?\nA well of sealed and secret happiness,\nWhose waters like blithe light and music are,\nVanquishing dissonance and gloom? A Star\nWhich moves not in the moving heavens, alone?\nA Smile amid dark frowns? a gentle tone\nAmid rude voices? a belov\u00e8d light?\nA Solitude, a Refuge, a Delight?\nA Lute, which those whom Love has taught to play\nMake music on, to soothe the roughest day\nAnd lull fond Grief asleep? a buried treasure?\nA cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure?\nA violet-shrouded grave of Woe?\u2014I measure\nThe world of fancies, seeking one like thee,\nAnd find\u2014alas! mine own infirmity.\nShe met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way,\nAnd lured me towards sweet Death; as Night by Day,\nWinter by Spring, or Sorrow by swift Hope,\nLed into light, life, peace. An antelope,\nIn the suspended impulse of its lightness,\nWere less aethereally light: the brightness\nOf her divinest presence trembles through\nHer limbs, as underneath a cloud of dew\nEmbodied in the windless heaven of June\nAmid the splendour-wing\u00e8d stars, the Moon\nBurns, inextinguishably beautiful:\nAnd from her lips, as from a hyacinth full\nOf honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops,\nKilling the sense with passion; sweet as stops\nOf planetary music heard in trance.\nIn her mild lights the starry spirits dance,\nThe sunbeams of those wells which ever leap\nUnder the lightnings of the soul\u2014too deep\nFor the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.\nThe glory of her being, issuing thence,\nStains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade\nOf unentangled intermixture, made\nBy Love, of light and motion: one intense\nDiffusion, one serene Omnipresence,\nWhose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing,\nAround her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing\nWith the unintermitted blood, which there\nQuivers, (as in a fleece of snow-like air\nThe crimson pulse of living morning quiver,)\nContinuously prolonged, and ending never,\nTill they are lost, and in that Beauty furled\nWhich penetrates and clasps and fills the world;\nScarce visible from extreme loveliness.\nWarm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress\nAnd her loose hair; and where some heavy tress\nThe air of her own speed has disentwined,\nThe sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind;\nAnd in the soul a wild odour is felt,\nBeyond the sense, like fiery dews that melt\nInto the bosom of a frozen bud.\u2014\nSee where she stands! a mortal shape indued\nWith love and life and light and deity,\nAnd motion which may change but cannot die;\nAn image of some bright Eternity;\nA shadow of some golden dream; a Splendour\nLeaving the third sphere pilotless; a tender\nReflection of the eternal Moon of Love\nUnder whose motions life's dull billows move;\nA Metaphor of Spring and Youth and Morning;\nA Vision like incarnate April, warning,\nWith smiles and tears, Frost the Anatomy\nInto his summer grave.\nAh, woe is me!\nWhat have I dared? where am I lifted? how\nShall I descend, and perish not? I know\nThat Love makes all things equal: I have heard\nBy mine own heart this joyous truth averred:\nThe spirit of the worm beneath the sod\nIn love and worship, blends itself with God.\nSpouse! Sister! Angel! Pilot of the Fate\nWhose course has been so starless! O too late\nBelov\u00e8d! O too soon adored, by me!\nFor in the fields of Immortality\nMy spirit should at first have worshipped thine,\nA divine presence in a place divine;\nOr should have moved beside it on this earth,\nA shadow of that substance, from its birth;\nBut not as now:\u2014I love thee; yes, I feel\nThat on the fountain of my heart a seal\nIs set, to keep its waters pure and bright\nFor thee, since in those tears thou hast delight.\nWe\u2014are we not formed, as notes of music are,\nFor one another, though dissimilar;\nSuch difference without discord, as can make\nThose sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake\nAs trembling leaves in a continuous air?\nThy wisdom speaks in me, and bids me dare\nBeacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.\nI never was attached to that great sect,\nWhose doctrine is, that each one should select\nOut of the crowd a mistress or a friend,\nAnd all the rest, though fair and wise, commend\nTo cold oblivion, though it is in the code\nOf modern morals, and the beaten road\nWhich those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread,\nWho travel to their home among the dead\nBy the broad highway of the world, and so\nWith one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,\nThe dreariest and the longest journey go.\nTrue Love in this differs from gold and clay,\nThat to divide is not to take away.\nLove is like understanding, that grows bright,\nGazing on many truths; 'tis like thy light,\nImagination! which from earth and sky,\nAnd from the depths of human fantasy,\nAs from a thousand prisms and mirrors, fills\nThe Universe with glorious beams, and kills\nError, the worm, with many a sun-like arrow\nOf its reverberated lightning. Narrow\nThe heart that loves, the brain that contemplates,\nThe life that wears, the spirit that creates\nOne object, and one form, and builds thereby\nA sepulchre for its eternity.\nMind from its object differs most in this:\nEvil from good; misery from happiness;\nThe baser from the nobler; the impure\nAnd frail, from what is clear and must endure.\nIf you divide suffering and dross, you may\nDiminish till it is consumed away;\nIf you divide pleasure and love and thought,\nEach part exceeds the whole; and we know not\nHow much, while any yet remains unshared,\nOf pleasure may be gained, of sorrow spared:\nThis truth is that deep well, whence sages draw\nThe unenvied light of hope; the eternal law\nBy which those live, to whom this world of life\nIs as a garden ravaged, and whose strife\nTills for the promise of a later birth\nThe wilderness of this Elysian earth.\nThere was a Being whom my spirit oft\nMet on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,\nIn the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn,\nUpon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,\nAmid the enchanted mountains, and the caves\nOf divine sleep, and on the air-like waves\nOf wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor\nPaved her light steps;\u2014on an imagined shore,\nUnder the gray beak of some promontory\nShe met me, robed in such exceeding glory,\nThat I beheld her not. In solitudes\nHer voice came to me through the whispering woods,\nAnd from the fountains, and the odours deep\nOf flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep\nOf the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,\nBreathed but of her to the enamoured air;\nAnd from the breezes whether low or loud,\nAnd from the rain of every passing cloud,\nAnd from the singing of the summer-birds,\nAnd from all sounds, all silence. In the words\nOf antique verse and high romance, -- in form,\nSound, colour -- in whatever checks that Storm\nWhich with the shattered present chokes the past;\nAnd in that best philosophy, whose taste\nMakes this cold common hell, our life, a doom\nAs glorious as a fiery martyrdom;\nHer Spirit was the harmony of truth.--\nThen, from the caverns of my dreamy youth\nI sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,\nAnd towards the lodestar of my one desire,\nI flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight\nIs as a dead leaf's in the owlet light,\nWhen it would seek in Hesper's setting sphere\nA radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,\nAs if it were a lamp of earthly flame.\u2014\nBut She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,\nPassed, like a God throned on a wing\u00e8d planet,\nWhose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,\nInto the dreary cone of our life's shade;\nAnd as a man with mighty loss dismayed,\nYawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen:\nWhen a voice said:--'O thou of hearts the weakest,\nThe phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.'\nThen I\u2014'Where?'--the world's echo answered 'where?'\nAnd in that silence, and in my despair,\nI questioned every tongueless wind that flew\nOver my tower of mourning, if it knew\nWhither 'twas fled, this soul out of my soul;\nAnd murmured names and spells which have control\nOver the sightless tyrants of our fate;\nBut neither prayer nor verse could dissipate\nThe night which closed on her; nor uncreate\nThat world within this Chaos, mine and me,\nOf which she was the veiled Divinity,\nThe world I say of thoughts that worshipped her:\nAnd therefore I went forth, with hope and fear\nAnd every gentle passion sick to death,\nFeeding my course with expectation's breath,\nInto the wintry forest of our life;\nAnd struggling through its error with vain strife,\nAnd stumbling in my weakness and my haste,\nAnd half bewildered by new forms, I passed,\nSeeking among those untaught foresters\nIf I could find one form resembling hers,\nIn which she might have masked herself from me.\nThere,\u2014One, whose voice was venomed melody\nSate by a well, under blue nightshade bowers;\nThe breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,\nHer touch was as electric poison,\u2014flame\nOut of her looks into my vitals came,\nAnd from her living cheeks and bosom flew\nA killing air, which pierced like honey-dew\nInto the core of my green heart, and lay\nUpon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray\nO'er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime\nWith ruins of unseasonable time.\nIn many mortal forms I rashly sought\nThe shadow of that idol of my thought.\nAnd some were fair\u2014but beauty dies away:\nOthers were wise\u2014but honeyed words betray:\nAnd One was true\u2014oh! why not true to me?\nThen, as a hunted deer that could not flee,\nI turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,\nWounded and weak and panting; the cold day\nTrembled, for pity of my strife and pain.\nWhen, like a noonday dawn, there shone again\nDeliverance. One stood on my path who seemed\nAs like the glorious shape which I had dreamed\nAs is the Moon, whose changes ever run\nInto themselves, to the eternal Sun;\nThe cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven's bright isles,\nWho makes all beautiful on which she smiles,\nThat wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame\nWhich ever is transformed, yet still the same,\nAnd warms not but illumines. Young and fair\nAs the descended Spirit of that sphere,\nShe hid me, as the Moon may hide the night\nFrom its own darkness, until all was bright\nBetween the Heaven and Earth of my calm mind,\nAnd, as a cloud charioted by the wind,\nShe led me to a cave in that wild place,\nAnd sate beside me, with her downward face\nIllumining my slumbers, like the Moon\nWaxing and waning o'er Endymion.\nAnd I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,\nAnd all my being became bright or dim\nAs the Moon's image in a summer sea,\nAccording as she smiled or frowned on me;\nAnd there I lay, within a chaste cold bed:\nAlas, I then was nor alive nor dead:\u2014\nFor at her silver voice came Death and Life,\nUnmindful each of their accustomed strife,\nMasked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,\nThe wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,\nAnd through the cavern without wings they flew,\nAnd cried 'Away, he is not of our crew.'\nI wept, and though it be a dream, I weep.\nWhat storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,\nBlotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips\nThen shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;\u2014\nAnd how my soul was as a lampless sea,\nAnd who was then its Tempest; and when She,\nThe Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost\nCrept o'er those waters, till from coast to coast\nThe moving billows of my being fell\nInto a death of ice, immovable;\u2014\nAnd then\u2014what earthquakes made it gape and split,\nThe white Moon smiling all the while on it,\nThese words conceal:\u2014If not, each word would be\nThe key of staunchless tears. Weep not for me!\nAt length, into the obscure Forest came\nThe Vision I had sought through grief and shame.\nAthwart that wintry wilderness of thorns\nFlashed from her motion splendour like the Morn's,\nAnd from her presence life was radiated\nThrough the gray earth and branches bare and dead;\nSo that her way was paved, and roofed above\nWith flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love;\nAnd music from her respiration spread\nLike light,\u2014all other sounds were penetrated\nBy the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,\nSo that the savage winds hung mute around;\nAnd odours warm and fresh fell from her hair\nDissolving the dull cold in the frore air:\nSoft as an Incarnation of the Sun,\nWhen light is changed to love, this glorious One\nFloated into the cavern where I lay,\nAnd called my Spirit, and the dreaming clay\nWas lifted by the thing that dreamed below\nAs smoke by fire, and in her beauty's glow\nI stood, and felt the dawn of my long night\nWas penetrating me with living light:\nI knew it was the Vision veiled from me\nSo many years -- that it was Emily.\nTwin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,\nThis world of love, this me; and into birth\nAwaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart\nMagnetic might into its central heart;\nAnd lift its billows and its mists, and guide\nBy everlasting laws, each wind and tide\nTo its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;\nAnd lull its storms, each in the craggy grave\nWhich was its cradle, luring to faint bowers\nThe armies of the rainbow-wing\u00e8d showers;\nAnd, as those married lights, which from the towers\nOf Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe\nIn liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;\nAnd all their many-mingled influence blend,\nIf equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;\u2014\nSo ye, bright regents, with alternate sway\nGovern my sphere of being, night and day!\nThou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;\nThou, not eclipsing a remoter light;\nAnd, through the shadow of the seasons three,\nFrom Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,\nLight it into the Winter of the tomb,\nWhere it may ripen to a brighter bloom.\nThou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,\nWho drew the heart of this frail Universe\nTowards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,\nAlternating attraction and repulsion,\nThine went astray and that was rent in twain;\nOh, float into our azure heaven again!\nBe there Love's folding-star at thy return;\nThe living Sun will feed thee from its urn\nOf golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn\nIn thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn\nWill worship thee with incense of calm breath\nAnd lights and shadows; as the star of Death\nAnd Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild\nCalled Hope and Fear\u2014upon the heart are piled\nTheir offerings,\u2014of this sacrifice divine\nA World shall be the altar.\nLady mine,\nScorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth\nWhich from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth\nWhose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,\nWill be as of the trees of Paradise.\nThe day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.\nTo whatsoe'er of dull mortality\nIs mine, remain a vestal sister still;\nTo the intense, the deep, the imperishable,\nNot mine but me, henceforth be thou united\nEven as a bride, delighting and delighted.\nThe hour is come:\u2014the destined Star has risen\nWhich shall descend upon a vacant prison.\nThe walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set\nThe sentinels\u2014but true Love never yet\nWas thus constrained: it overleaps all fence:\nLike lightning, with invisible violence\nPiercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,\nWhich he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,\nWho rides upon a thought, and makes his way\nThrough temple, tower, and palace, and the array\nOf arms: more strength has Love than he or they;\nFor it can burst his charnel, and make free\nThe limbs in chains, the heart in agony,\nThe soul in dust and chaos.\nEmily,\nA ship is floating in the harbour now,\nA wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;\nThere is a path on the sea's azure floor,\nNo keel has ever ploughed that path before;\nThe halcyons brood around the foamless isles;\nThe treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;\nThe merry mariners are bold and free:\nSay, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?\nOur bark is as an albatross, whose nest\nIs a far Eden of the purple East;\nAnd we between her wings will sit, while Night,\nAnd Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,\nOur ministers, along the boundless Sea,\nTreading each other's heels, unheededly.\nIt is an isle under Ionian skies,\nBeautiful as a wreck of Paradise,\nAnd, for the harbours are not safe and good,\nThis land would have remained a solitude\nBut for some pastoral people native there,\nWho from the Elysian, clear, and golden air\nDraw the last spirit of the age of gold,\nSimple and spirited; innocent and bold.\nThe blue Aegean girds this chosen home,\nWith ever-changing sound and light and foam,\nKissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;\nAnd all the winds wandering along the shore\nUndulate with the undulating tide:\nThere are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;\nAnd many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,\nAs clear as elemental diamond,\nOr serene morning air; and far beyond,\nThe mossy tracks made by the goats and deer\n(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)\nPierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls\nBuilt round with ivy, which the waterfalls\nIllumining, with sound that never fails\nAccompany the noonday nightingales;\nAnd all the place is peopled with sweet airs;\nThe light clear element which the isle wears\nIs heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,\nWhich floats like mist laden with unseen showers,\nAnd falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;\nAnd from the moss violets and jonquils peep,\nAnd dart their arrowy odour through the brain\nTill you might faint with that delicious pain.\nAnd every motion, odour, beam, and tone,\nWith that deep music is in unison:\nWhich is a soul within the soul\u2014they seem\nLike echoes of an antenatal dream.\u2014\nIt is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,\nCradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;\nBright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,\nWashed by the soft blue Oceans of young air.\nIt is a favoured place. Famine or Blight,\nPestilence, War and Earthquake, never light\nUpon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they\nSail onward far upon their fatal way:\nThe wing\u00e8d storms, chanting their thunder-psalm\nTo other lands, leave azure chasms of calm\nOver this isle, or weep themselves in dew,\nFrom which its fields and woods ever renew\nTheir green and golden immortality.\nAnd from the sea there rise, and from the sky\nThere fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,\nVeil after veil, each hiding some delight,\nWhich Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,\nTill the isle's beauty, like a naked bride\nGlowing at once with love and loveliness,\nBlushes and trembles at its own excess:\nYet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less\nBurns in the heart of this delicious isle,\nAn atom of th'Eternal, whose own smile\nUnfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen\nO'er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,\nFilling their bare and void interstices.\u2014\nBut the chief marvel of the wilderness\nIs a lone dwelling, built by whom or how\nNone of the rustic island-people know:\n'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height\nIt overtops the woods; but, for delight,\nSome wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime\nHad been invented, in the world's young prime,\nReared it, a wonder of that simple time,\nAn envy of the isles, a pleasure-house\nMade sacred to his sister and his spouse.\nIt scarce seems now a wreck of human art,\nBut, as it were Titanic; in the heart\nOf Earth having assumed its form, then grown\nOut of the mountains, from the living stone,\nLifting itself in caverns light and high:\nFor all the antique and learn\u00e8d imagery\nHas been erased, and in the place of it\nThe ivy and the wild-vine interknit\nThe volumes of their many-twining stems;\nParasite flowers illume with dewy gems\nThe lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky\nPeeps through their winter-woof of tracery\nWith moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,\nOr fragments of the day's intense serene;\u2014\nWorking mosaic on their Parian floors.\nAnd, day and night, aloof, from the high towers\nAnd terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem\nTo sleep in one another's arms, and dream\nOf waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we\nRead in their smiles, and call reality.\nThis isle and house are mine, and I have vowed\nThee to be lady of the solitude.\u2014\nAnd I have fitted up some chambers there\nLooking towards the golden Eastern air,\nAnd level with the living winds, which flow\nLike waves above the living waves below.\u2014\nI have sent books and music there, and all\nThose instruments with which high Spirits call\nThe future from its cradle, and the past\nOut of its grave, and make the present last\nIn thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,\nFolded within their own eternity.\nOur simple life wants little, and true taste\nHires not the pale drudge Luxury, to waste\nThe scene it would adorn, and therefore still,\nNature with all her children haunts the hill.\nThe ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet\nKeeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit\nRound the evening tower, and the young stars glance\nBetween the quick bats in their twilight dance;\nThe spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight\nBefore our gate, and the slow, silent night\nIs measured by the pants of their calm sleep.\nBe this our home in life, and when years heap\nTheir withered hours, like leaves, on our decay,\nLet us become the overhanging day,\nThe living soul of this Elysian isle,\nConscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile\nWe two will rise, and sit, and walk together,\nUnder the roof of blue Ionian weather,\nAnd wander in the meadows, or ascend\nThe mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend\nWith lightest winds, to touch their paramour;\nOr linger, where the pebble-paven shore,\nUnder the quick, faint kisses of the sea\nTrembles and sparkles as with ecstasy,\u2014\nPossessing and possessed by all that is\nWithin that calm circumference of bliss,\nAnd by each other, till to love and live\nBe one:\u2014or, at the noontide hour, arrive\nWhere some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep\nThe moonlight of the expired night asleep,\nThrough which the awakened day can never peep;\nA veil for our seclusion, close as night's,\nWhere secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights;\nSleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain\nWhose drops quench kisses till they burn again.\nAnd we will talk, until thought's melody\nBecome too sweet for utterance, and it die\nIn words, to live again in looks, which dart\nWith thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,\nHarmonizing silence without a sound.\nOur breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,\nAnd our veins beat together; and our lips\nWith other eloquence than words, eclipse\nThe soul that burns between them, and the wells\nWhich boil under our being's inmost cells,\nThe fountains of our deepest life, shall be\nConfused in Passion's golden purity,\nAs mountain-springs under the morning sun.\nWe shall become the same, we shall be one\nSpirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?\nOne passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,\nTill like two meteors of expanding flame,\nThose spheres instinct with it become the same,\nTouch, mingle, are transfigured; ever still\nBurning, yet ever inconsumable:\nIn one another's substance finding food,\nLike flames too pure and light and unimbued\nTo nourish their bright lives with baser prey,\nWhich point to Heaven and cannot pass away:\nOne hope within two wills, one will beneath\nTwo overshadowing minds, one life, one death,\nOne Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,\nAnd one annihilation.

{"title": "Epipsychidion (Excerpt)", "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "text": "Emily,\nA ship is floating in the harbour now,\nA wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;\nThere is a path on the sea's azure floor,\nNo keel has ever plough'd that path before;\nThe halcyons brood around the foamless isles;\nThe treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;\nThe merry mariners are bold and free:\nSay, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?\nOur bark is as an albatross, whose nest\nIs a far Eden of the purple East;\nAnd we between her wings will sit, while Night,\nAnd Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,\nOur ministers, along the boundless Sea,\nTreading each other's heels, unheededly.\nIt is an isle under Ionian skies,\nBeautiful as a wreck of Paradise,\nAnd, for the harbours are not safe and good,\nThis land would have remain'd a solitude\nBut for some pastoral people native there,\nWho from the Elysian, clear, and golden air\nDraw the last spirit of the age of gold,\nSimple and spirited; innocent and bold.\nThe blue Aegean girds this chosen home,\nWith ever-changing sound and light and foam,\nKissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;\nAnd all the winds wandering along the shore\nUndulate with the undulating tide:\nThere are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;\nAnd many a fountain, rivulet and pond,\nAs clear as elemental diamond,\nOr serene morning air; and far beyond,\nThe mossy tracks made by the goats and deer\n(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)\nPierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls\nBuilt round with ivy, which the waterfalls\nIllumining, with sound that never fails\nAccompany the noonday nightingales;\nAnd all the place is peopled with sweet airs;\nThe light clear element which the isle wears\nIs heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,\nWhich floats like mist laden with unseen showers,\nAnd falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;\nAnd from the moss violets and jonquils peep\nAnd dart their arrowy odour through the brain\nTill you might faint with that delicious pain.\nAnd every motion, odour, beam and tone,\nWith that deep music is in unison:\nWhich is a soul within the soul--they seem\nLike echoes of an antenatal dream.\nIt is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth and Sea,\nCradled and hung in clear tranquillity;\nBright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,\nWash'd by the soft blue Oceans of young air.\nIt is a favour'd place. Famine or Blight,\nPestilence, War and Earthquake, never light\nUpon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they\nSail onward far upon their fatal way:\nThe wing\u00e8d storms, chanting their thunder-psalm\nTo other lands, leave azure chasms of calm\nOver this isle, or weep themselves in dew,\nFrom which its fields and woods ever renew\nTheir green and golden immortality.\nAnd from the sea there rise, and from the sky\nThere fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,\nVeil after veil, each hiding some delight,\nWhich Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,\nTill the isle's beauty, like a naked bride\nGlowing at once with love and loveliness,\nBlushes and trembles at its own excess:\nYet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less\nBurns in the heart of this delicious isle,\nAn atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile\nUnfolds itself, and may be felt not seen\nO'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green,\nFilling their bare and void interstices.\nBut the chief marvel of the wilderness\nIs a lone dwelling, built by whom or how\nNone of the rustic island-people know:\n'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height\nIt overtops the woods; but, for delight,\nSome wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime\nHad been invented, in the world's young prime,\nRear'd it, a wonder of that simple time,\nAn envy of the isles, a pleasure-house\nMade sacred to his sister and his spouse.\nIt scarce seems now a wreck of human art,\nBut, as it were, Titanic; in the heart\nOf Earth having assum'd its form, then grown\nOut of the mountains, from the living stone,\nLifting itself in caverns light and high:\nFor all the antique and learned imagery\nHas been eras'd, and in the place of it\nThe ivy and the wild-vine interknit\nThe volumes of their many-twining stems;\nParasite flowers illume with dewy gems\nThe lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky\nPeeps through their winter-woof of tracery\nWith moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,\nOr fragments of the day's intense serene;\nWorking mosaic on their Parian floors.\nAnd, day and night, aloof, from the high towers\nAnd terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem\nTo sleep in one another's arms, and dream\nOf waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we\nRead in their smiles, and call reality.\nThis isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd\nThee to be lady of the solitude.\nAnd I have fitted up some chambers there\nLooking towards the golden Eastern air,\nAnd level with the living winds, which flow\nLike waves above the living waves below.\nI have sent books and music there, and all\nThose instruments with which high Spirits call\nThe future from its cradle, and the past\nOut of its grave, and make the present last\nIn thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,\nFolded within their own eternity.\nOur simple life wants little, and true taste\nHires not the pale drudge Luxury to waste\nThe scene it would adorn, and therefore still,\nNature with all her children haunts the hill.\nThe ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet\nKeeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit\nRound the evening tower, and the young stars glance\nBetween the quick bats in their twilight dance;\nThe spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight\nBefore our gate, and the slow, silent night\nIs measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep.\nBe this our home in life, and when years heap\nTheir wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay,\nLet us become the overhanging day,\nThe living soul of this Elysian isle,\nConscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile\nWe two will rise, and sit, and walk together,\nUnder the roof of blue Ionian weather,\nAnd wander in the meadows, or ascend\nThe mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend\nWith lightest winds, to touch their paramour;\nOr linger, where the pebble-paven shore,\nUnder the quick, faint kisses of the sea,\nTrembles and sparkles as with ecstasy--\nPossessing and possess'd by all that is\nWithin that calm circumference of bliss,\nAnd by each other, till to love and live\nBe one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive\nWhere some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep\nThe moonlight of the expir'd night asleep,\nThrough which the awaken'd day can never peep;\nA veil for our seclusion, close as night's,\nWhere secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights;\nSleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain\nWhose drops quench kisses till they burn again.\nAnd we will talk, until thought's melody\nBecome too sweet for utterance, and it die\nIn words, to live again in looks, which dart\nWith thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,\nHarmonizing silence without a sound.\nOur breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,\nAnd our veins beat together; and our lips\nWith other eloquence than words, eclipse\nThe soul that burns between them, and the wells\nWhich boil under our being's inmost cells,\nThe fountains of our deepest life, shall be\nConfus'd in Passion's golden purity,\nAs mountain-springs under the morning sun.\nWe shall become the same, we shall be one\nSpirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?\nOne passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,\nTill like two meteors of expanding flame,\nThose spheres instinct with it become the same,\nTouch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still\nBurning, yet ever inconsumable:\nIn one another's substance finding food,\nLike flames too pure and light and unimbu'd\nTo nourish their bright lives with baser prey,\nWhich point to Heaven and cannot pass away:\nOne hope within two wills, one will beneath\nTwo overshadowing minds, one life, one death,\nOne Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,\nAnd one annihilation. Woe is me!\nThe winged words on which my soul would pierce\nInto the height of Love's rare Universe,\nAre chains of lead around its flight of fire--\nI pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326908-Epipsychidion--Excerpt--by-Percy-Bysshe-Shelley"}
{"title": "Epipsychidion: Passages Of The Poem, Or Connected Therewith", "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "text": "Here, my dear friend, is a new book for you;\nI have already dedicated two\nTo other friends, one female and one male,--\nWhat you are, is a thing that I must veil;\nWhat can this be to those who praise or rail?\nI never was attached to that great sect\nWhose doctrine is that each one should select\nOut of the world a mistress or a friend,\nAnd all the rest, though fair and wise, commend\nTo cold oblivion\u2014though 'tis in the code\nOf modern morals, and the beaten road\nWhich those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread\nWho travel to their home among the dead\nBy the broad highway of the world\u2014and so\nWith one sad friend, and many a jealous foe,\nThe dreariest and the longest journey go.\nFree love has this, different from gold and clay,\nThat to divide is not to take away.\nLike ocean, which the general north wind breaks\nInto ten thousand waves, and each one makes\nA mirror of the moon -- like some great glass,\nWhich did distort whatever form might pass,\nDashed into fragments by a playful child,\nWhich then reflects its eyes and forehead mild;\nGiving for one, which it could ne'er express,\nA thousand images of loveliness.\nIf I were one whom the loud world held wise,\nI should disdain to quote authorities\nIn commendation of this kind of love:--\nWhy there is first the God in heaven above,\nWho wrote a book called Nature, 'tis to be\nReviewed, I hear, in the next Quarterly;\nAnd Socrates, the Jesus Christ of Greece,\nAnd Jesus Christ Himself, did never cease\nTo urge all living things to love each other,\nAnd to forgive their mutual faults, and smother\nThe Devil of disunion in their souls.\n. . .\nI love you!-- Listen, O embodied Ray\nOf the great Brightness; I must pass away\nWhile you remain, and these light words must be\nTokens by which you may remember me.\nStart not\u2014the thing you are is unbetrayed,\nIf you are human, and if but the shade\nOf some sublimer spirit . . .\n. . .\nAnd as to friend or mistress, 'tis a form;\nPerhaps I wish you were one. Some declare\nYou a familiar spirit, as you are;\nOthers with a . . . more inhuman\nHint that, though not my wife, you are a woman;\nWhat is the colour of your eyes and hair?\nWhy, if you were a lady, it were fair\nThe world should know\u2014but, as I am afraid,\nThe Quarterly would bait you if betrayed;\nAnd if, as it will be sport to see them stumble\nOver all sorts of scandals, hear them mumble\nTheir litany of curses\u2014some guess right,\nAnd others swear you're a Hermaphrodite;\nLike that sweet marble monster of both sexes,\nWhich looks so sweet and gentle that it vexes\nThe very soul that the soul is gone\nWhich lifted from her limbs the veil of stone.\n. . .\nIt is a sweet thing, friendship, a dear balm,\nA happy and auspicious bird of calm,\nWhich rides o'er life's ever tumultuous Ocean;\nA God that broods o'er chaos in commotion;\nA flower which fresh as Lapland roses are,\nLifts its bold head into the world's frore air,\nAnd blooms most radiantly when others die,\nHealth, hope, and youth, and brief prosperity;\nAnd with the light and odour of its bloom,\nShining within the dungeon and the tomb;\nWhose coming is as light and music are\n'Mid dissonance and gloom -- a star\nWhich moves not 'mid the moving heavens alone--\nA smile among dark frowns\u2014a gentle tone\nAmong rude voices, a belov\u00e8d light,\nA solitude, a refuge, a delight.\nIf I had but a friend! Why, I have three\nEven by my own confession; there may be\nSome more, for what I know, for 'tis my mind\nTo call my friends all who are wise and kind,--\nAnd these, Heaven knows, at best are very few;\nBut none can ever be more dear than you.\nWhy should they be? My muse has lost her wings,\nOr like a dying swan who soars and sings,\nI should describe you in heroic style,\nBut as it is, are you not void of guile?\nA lovely soul, formed to be blessed and bless:\nA well of sealed and secret happiness;\nA lute which those whom Love has taught to play\nMake music on to cheer the roughest day,\nAnd enchant sadness till it sleeps? . . .\n. . .\nTo the oblivion whither I and thou,\nAll loving and all lovely, hasten now\nWith steps, ah, too unequal! may we meet\nIn one Elysium or one winding-sheet!\nIf any should be curious to discover\nWhether to you I am a friend or lover,\nLet them read Shakespeare's sonnets, taking thence\nA whetstone for their dull intelligence\nThat tears and will not cut, or let them guess\nHow Diotima, the wise prophetess,\nInstructed the instructor, and why he\nRebuked the infant spirit of melody\nOn Agathon's sweet lips, which as he spoke\nWas as the lovely star when morn has broke\nThe roof of darkness, in the golden dawn,\nHalf-hidden, and yet beautiful.\nI'll pawn\nMy hopes of Heaven\u2014you know what they are worth--\nThat the presumptuous pedagogues of Earth,\nIf they could tell the riddle offered here\nWould scorn to be, or being to appear\nWhat now they seem and are -- but let them chide,\nThey have few pleasures in the world beside;\nPerhaps we should be dull were we not chidden,\nParadise fruits are sweetest when forbidden.\nFolly can season Wisdom, Hatred Love.\n. . .\nFarewell, if it can be to say farewell\nTo those who . . .\n. . .\nI will not, as most dedicators do,\nAssure myself and all the world and you,\nThat you are faultless -- would to God they were\nWho taunt me with your love! I then should wear\nThese heavy chains of life with a light spirit,\nAnd would to God I were, or even as near it\nAs you, dear heart. Alas! what are we? Clouds\nDriven by the wind in warring multitudes,\nWhich rain into the bosom of the earth,\nAnd rise again, and in our death and birth,\nAnd through our restless life, take as from heaven\nHues which are not our own, but which are given,\nAnd then withdrawn, and with inconstant glance\nFlash from the spirit to the countenance.\nThere is a Power, a Love, a Joy, a God\nWhich makes in mortal hearts its brief abode,\nA Pythian exhalation, which inspires\nLove, only love -- a wind which o'er the wires\nOf the soul's giant harp\nThere is a mood which language faints beneath;\nYou feel it striding, as Almighty Death\nHis bloodless steed . . .\n. . .\nAnd what is that most brief and bright delight\nWhich rushes through the touch and through the sight,\nAnd stands before the spirit's inmost throne,\nA naked Seraph? None hath ever known.\nIts birth is darkness, and its growth desire;\nUntameable and fleet and fierce as fire,\nNot to be touched but to be felt alone,\nIt fills the world with glory -- and is gone.\n. . .\nIt floats with rainbow pinions o'er the stream\nOf life, which flows, like a . . . dream\nInto the light of morning, to the grave\nAs to an ocean . . .\n. . .\nWhat is that joy which serene infancy\nPerceives not, as the hours content them by,\nEach in a chain of blossoms, yet enjoys\nThe shapes of this new world, in giant toys\nWrought by the busy . . . ever new?\nRemembrance borrows Fancy's glass, to show\nThese forms more . . . sincere\nThan now they are, than then, perhaps, they were.\nWhen everything familiar seemed to be\nWonderful, and the immortality\nOf this great world, which all things must inherit,\nWas felt as one with the awakening spirit,\nUnconscious of itself, and of the strange\nDistinctions which in its proceeding change\nIt feels and knows, and mourns as if each were\nA desolation . . .\n. . .\nWere it not a sweet refuge, Emily,\nFor all those exiles from the dull insane\nWho vex this pleasant world with pride and pain,\nFor all that band of sister-spirits known\nTo one another by a voiceless tone?\n. . .\nIf day should part us night will mend division\nAnd if sleep parts us -- we will meet in vision\nAnd if life parts us -- we will mix in death\nYielding our mite [?] of unreluctant breath\nDeath cannot part us -- we must meet again\nIn all in nothing in delight in pain:\nHow, why or when or where\u2014it matters not\nSo that we share an undivided lot . . .\n. . .\nAnd we will move possessing and possessed\nWherever beauty on the earth's bare [?] breast\nLies like the shadow of thy soul -- till we\nBecome one being with the world we see . . .\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Epipsychidion:-Passages-Of-The-Poem,-Or-Connected-Therewith"}

She had a fifth of unopened whiskey in a bag.\n\"George, I left that son of a bitch, I couldn't stand that son of a bitch\nanymore.\"\n\"Sit down.\"\nGeorge opened the fifth, got two glasses, filled each a third with whiskey, two thirds\nwith water. He sat down on the bed with Constance. She took a cigarette out of her purse\nand lit it. She was drunk and her hands trembled.\n\"I took his damn money too. I took his damn money and split while he was at work.\nYou don't know how I've suffered with that son of a bitch.\" \"\nLemme have a smoke,\" said George. She handed it to him and as she leaned near,\nGeorge put his arm around her, pulled her over and kissed her.\n\"You son of a bitch,\" she said, \"I missed you.\"\n\"I miss those good legs of yours , Connie. I've really missed those good\nlegs.\"\n\"You still like 'em?\"\n\"I get hot just looking.\"\n\"I could never make it with a college guy,\" said Connie. \"They're too\nsoft, they're milk toast. And he kept his house clean. George , it was like having a maid.\nHe did it all. The place was spotless. You could eat beef stew right off the crapper. He\nwas antiseptic, that's what he was.\"\n\"Drink up, you'll feel better.\"\n\"And he couldn't make love.\"\n\"You mean he couldn't get it up?\"\n\"Oh he got it up, he got it up all the time. But he didn't know how to make a\nwoman happy, you know. He didn't know what to do. All that money, all that education, he\nwas useless.\"\n\"I wish I had a college education.\"\n\"You don't need one. You have everything you need, George.\"\n\"I'm just a flunky. All the shit jobs.\"\n\"I said you have everything you need, George. You know how to make a woman\nhappy.\"\n\"Yeh?\"\n\"Yes. And you know what else? His mother came around! His mother! Two or three\ntimes a week. And she'd sit there looking at me, pretending to like me but all the time\nshe was treating me like I was a whore. Like I was a big bad whore stealing her son away\nfrom her! Her precious Wallace! Christ! What a mess!\" \"He claimed he loved me.\nAnd I'd say, 'Look at my pussy, Walter!' And he wouldn't look at my pussy. He said, 'I\ndon't want to look at that thing.' That thing! That's what he called it! You're not afraid\nof my pussy, are you, George?\"\n\"It's never bit me yet.\" \"But you've bit it, you've nibbled it, haven't\nyou George?\"\n\"I suppose I have.\"\n\"And you've licked it , sucked it?\"\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\"You know damn well, George, what you've done.\"\n\"How much money did you get?\"\n\"Six hundred dollars.\"\n\"I don't like people who rob other people, Connie.\"\n\"That's why you're a fucking dishwasher. You're honest. But he's such an ass,\nGeorge. And he can afford the money, and I've earned it\u2026 him and his mother and his\nlove, his mother-love, his clean l;little wash bowls and toilets and disposal bags and\nbreath chasers and after shave lotions and his little hard-ons and his precious\nlovemaking. All for himself, you understand, all for himself! You know what a woman\nwants, George.\"\n\"Thanks for the whiskey, Connie. Lemme have another cigarette.\"\nGeorge filled them up again. \"I missed your legs, Connie. I've really missed those\nlegs. I like the way you wear those high heels. They drive me crazy. These modern women\ndon't know what they're missing. The high heel shapes the calf, the thigh, the ass; it\nputs rhythm into the walk. It really turns me on!\"\n\"You talk like a poet, George. Sometimes you talk like that. You are one hell of a\ndishwasher.\"\n\"You know what I'd really like to do?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I'd like to whip you with my belt on the legs, the ass, the thighs. I'd like to\nmake you quiver and cry and then when you're quivering and crying I'd slam it into you\npure love.\"\n\"I don't want that, George. You've never talked like that to me before. You've\nalways done right with me.\"\n\"Pull your dress up higher.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Pull your dress up higher, I want to see more of your legs.\"\n\"You like my legs, don't you, George?\"\n\"Let the light shine on them!\"\nConstance hiked her dress.\n\"God Christ shit,\" said George.\n\"You like my legs?\"\n\"I love your legs!\" Then George reached across the bed and slapped Constance\nhard across the face. Her cigarette flipped out of her mouth.\n\"what'd you do that for?\"\n\"You fucked Walter! You fucked Walter!\"\n\"So what the hell?\"\n\"So pull your dress up higher!\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Do what I say!\" George slapped again, harder. Constance hiked her skirt.\n\"Just up to the panties!\" shouted George. \"I don't quite want to see the\npanties!\"\n\"Christ, George, what's gone wrong with you?\"\n\"You fucked Walter!\"\n\"George, I swear, you've gone crazy. I want to leave. Let me out of here,\nGeorge!\"\n\"Don't move or I'll kill you!\"\n\"You'd kill me?\"\n\"I swear it!\" George got up and poured himself a shot of straight whiskey,\ndrank it, and sat down next to Constance. He took the cigarette and held it against her\nwrist. She screamed. HE held it there, firmly, then pulled it away.\n\"I'm a man , baby, understand that?\"\n\"I know you're a man , George.\"\n\"Here, look at my muscles!\" George sat up and flexed both of his arms.\n\"Beautiful, eh ,baby? Look at that muscle! Feel it! Feel it!\"\nConstance felt one of the arms, then the other.\n\"Yes, you have a beautiful body, George.\"\n\"I'm a man. I'm a dishwasher but I'm a man, a real man.\"\n\"I know it, George.\" \"I'm not the milk shit you left.\"\n\"I know it.\"\n\"And I can sing, too. You ought to hear my voice.\"\nConstance sat there. George began to sing. He sang \"Old man River.\" Then he\nsang \"Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.\" He sang \"The St. Louis\nBlues.\" He Sang \"God Bless America,\" stopping several times and laughing.\nThen he sat down next to Constance. He said, \"Connie, you have beautiful legs.\"\nHe asked for another cigarette. He smoked it, drank two more drinks, then put his head\ndown on Connie's legs, against the stockings, in her lap, and he said, \"Connie, I\nguess I'm no good, I guess I'm crazy, I'm sorry I hit you, I'm sorry I burned you with\nthat cigarette.\"\nConstance sat there. She ran her fingers through George's hair, stroking him, soothing\nhim. Soon he was asleep. She waited a while longer. Then she lifted his head and placed it\non the pillow, lifted his legs and straightened them out on the bed. She stood up, walked\nto the fifth, poured a jolt of good whiskey in to her glass, added a touch of water and\ndrank it sown. She walked to the trailer door, pulled it open, stepped out, closed it. She\nwalked through the backyard, opened the fence gate, walked up the alley under the one\no'clock moon. The sky was clear of clouds. The same sky full of clouds was up there. She got\nout on the boulevard and walked east and reached the entrance of The Blue Mirror. She\nwalked in, and there was Walter sitting alone and drunk at the end of the bar. She walked\nup and sat down next to him. \"Missed me, baby?\" she asked. Walter looked up. He\nrecognized her. He didn't answer. He looked at the bartender and the bartender walked\ntoward them They all knew each other.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509497-A-Man-by-Charles-Bukowski"}

Poising their shapes\nBetween the snuff and red tar-paper apartments,\nThey mound a summer coolness in our view.\nTo people who live in the bottom of valleys\nA rise in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks\nTo be meant for climbing. A peculiar logic\nIn going up for the coming down if the post\nWe start at's the same post we finish by,\nBut it's the clear conversion at the top can hold\nUs to the oblique road, in spite of a fitful\nWish for even ground, and it's the last cliff\nLedge will dislodge out cramped concept of space, unwall\nHorizons beyond vision, spill vision\nAfter the horizons, stretching the narrowed eye\nTo full capacity. We climb to hopes\nOf such seeing up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,\nBlindered by green, under a green-grained sky\nInto the blue. Tops define themselves as places\nWhere nothing higher's to be looked to.

Flux\nOf the desultory currents \u2014- all that unique\nStripple of shifting wave-tips is ironed out, lost\nIn the simplified orderings of sky-\nLorded perspectives. Maplike, the far fields are ruled\nBy correct green lines and no seedy free-for-all\nOf asparagus heads. Cars run their suave\nColored beads on the strung roads, and the people stroll\nStraightforwardly across the springing green.\nAll's peace and discipline down there. Till lately we\nLived under the shadow of hot rooftops\nAnd never saw how coolly we might move.

it is the hearse of a dad foot,\nThe high, dead, toeless foot of this priest\nWho plumbs the well of his book,\nThe bent print bulging before him like scenery.\nObscene bikinis hid in the dunes,\nBreasts and hips a confectioner's sugar\nOf little crystals, titillating the light,\nWhile a green pool opens its eye,\nSick with what it has swallowed\u2014\u2014\nLimbs, images, shrieks. \u00a0Behind the concrete bunkers\nTwo lovers unstick themselves.\nO white sea-crockery,\nWhat cupped sighs, what salt in the throat\u2026.\nAnd the onlooker, trembling,\nDrawn like a long material\nThrough a still virulence,\nAnd a weed, hairy as privates.\n(3)\nOn the balconies of the hotel, things are glittering.\nThings, things\u2014\u2014\nTubular steel wheelchairs, aluminum crutches.\nSuch salt-sweetness. \u00a0Why should I walk\nBeyond the breakwater, spotty with barnacles?\nI am not a nurse, white and attendant,\nI am not a smile.\nThese children are after something, with hooks and cries,\nAnd my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults.\nThis is the side of a man: \u00a0his red ribs,\nThe nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon:\nOne mirrory eye\u2014\u2014\nA facet of knowledge.\nOn a striped mattress in one room\nAn old man is vanishing.\nWhere are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,\nAnd the tongue, sapphire of ash.\n(4)\nA

bed is rolled from the wall.\nThis is what it is to be complete. \u00a0It is horrible.\nIs he wearing pajamas or an evening suit\nUnder the glued sheet from which his powdery beak\nRises so whitely unbuffeted?\nThey propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened\nAnd folded his hands, that were shaking: \u00a0goodbye, goodbye.\nNow the washed sheets fly in the sun,\nThe pillow cases are sweetening.\nIt is a blessing, it is a blessing:\nThe long coffin of soap-colored oak,\nThe curious bearers and the raw date\nEngraving itself in silver with marvelous calm.\n(5)\nThe gray sky lowers, the hills like a green sea\nRun fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows,\nThe hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife\u2014\u2014\nBlunt, practical boats\nFull of dresses and hats and china and married daughters.\nIn the parlor of the stone house\nOne curtain is flickering from the open window,\nFlickering and pouring, a pitiful candle.\nThis is the tongue of the dead man: \u00a0remember, remember.\nHow far he is now, his actions\nAround him like living room furniture, like a d\u00e9cor.\nAs the pallors gather\u2014\u2014\nThe pallors of hands and neighborly faces,\nThe elate pallors of flying iris.\nThey are flying off into nothing: \u00a0remember us.\nThe empty benches of memory look over stones,\nMarble facades with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.\nIt is so beautiful up here: \u00a0it is a stopping place.\n(6)\nThe natural fatness of these lime leaves!\u2014\u2014\nPollarded green balls, the trees march to church.\nThe voice of the priest, in thin air,\nMeets the corpse at the gate,\nAddressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell;\nA glittler of wheat and crude earth.\nWhat is the name of that color?\u2014\u2014\nOld blood of caked walls the sun heals,\nOld blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts.\nThe widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters,\nNecessary among the flowers,\nEnfolds her lace like fine linen,\nNot to be spread again.\nWhile a sky, wormy with put-by smiles,\nPasses cloud after cloud.\nAnd the bride flowers expend a freshness,\nAnd the soul is a bride\nIn a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless.\n(7)\nBehind the glass of this car\nThe world purrs, shut-off and gentle.\nAnd I am dark-suited and still, a member of the party,\nGliding up in low gear behind the cart.\nAnd the priest is a vessel,\nA tarred fabric, sorry and dull,\nA crest of breasts, eyelids and lips\nStorming the hilltop.\nThen, from the barred yard, the children\nSmell the melt of shoe-blacking,\nTheir faces turning, wordless and slow,\nTheir eyes opening\nOn a wonderful thing\u2014\u2014\nSix round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood,\nAnd a naked mouth, red and awkward.\nFor a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma.\nThere is no hope, it is given up.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow

whence came ye!\nSo many, and so many, and such glee?\nWhy have ye left your bowers desolate,\nYour lutes, and gentler fate?\u2014\nA conquering!\nBacchus, young Bacchus! good or ill betide,\nWe dance before him thorough kingdoms wide:\u2014\nCome hither, lady fair, and joined be\nTo our wild minstrelsy!'\n\"Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs!

Where is he?\u2014\nEven these words went echoing dismally\nThrough the wide forest\u2014a most fearful tone,\nLike one repenting in his latest moan;\nAnd while it died away a shade pass'd by,\nAs of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly\nThrough the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth\nTheir timid necks and tremble; so these both\nLeant to each other trembling, and sat so\nWaiting for some destruction\u2014when lo,\nFoot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime\nBeyond the tall tree tops; and in less time\nThan shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt\nTowards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt\nOne moment from his home: only the sward\nHe with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward\nSwifter than sight was gone\u2014even before\nThe teeming earth a sudden witness bore\nOf his swift magic. Diving swans appear\nAbove the crystal circlings white and clear;\nAnd catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,\nHow they can dive in sight and unseen rise\u2014\nSo from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,\nEach with large dark blue wings upon his back.\nThe youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame\nOn one, and felt himself in spleen to tame\nThe other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,\nHigh as the eagles. Like two drops of dew\nExhal'd to Phoebus' lips, away they are gone,\nFar from the earth away\u2014unseen, alone,\nAmong cool clouds and winds, but that the free,\nThe buoyant life of song can floating be\nMuse of my native land, am I inspir'd?\nThis is the giddy air, and I must spread\nWide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread\nOr height, or depth, or width, or any chance\nPrecipitous: I have beneath my glance\nThose towering horses and their mournful freight.\nCould I thus sail, and see, and thus await\nFearless for power of thought, without thine aid?\u2014\nThere is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade\nFrom some approaching wonder, and behold\nThose winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold\nSnuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,\nDying to embers from their native fire!\nThere curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,\nIt seem'd as when around the pale new moon\nSad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:\n'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.\nFor the first time, since he came nigh dead born\nFrom the old womb of night, his cave forlorn\nHad he left more forlorn; for the first time,\nHe felt aloof the day and morning's prime\u2014\nBecause into his depth Cimmerian\nThere came a dream, shewing how a young man,\nEre a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,\nWould at high Jove's empyreal footstool win\nAn immortality, and how espouse\nJove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.\nNow was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,\nThat he might at the threshold one hour wait\nTo hear the marriage melodies, and then\nSink downward to his dusky cave again.\nHis litter of smooth semilucent mist,\nDiversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,\nPuzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;\nAnd scarcely for one moment could be caught\nHis sluggish form reposing motionless.\nThose two on winged steeds, with all the stress\nOf vision search'd for him, as one would look\nAthwart the sallows of a river nook\nTo catch a glance at silver throated eels,\u2014\nOr from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals\nHis rugged forehead in a mantle pale,\nWith an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale\nDescry a favourite hamlet faint and far.\nThese raven horses, though they foster'd are\nOf earth's splenetic fire, dully drop\nTheir full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;\nUpon the spiritless mist have they outspread\nTheir ample feathers, are in slumber dead,\u2014\nAnd on those pinions, level in mid air,\nEndymion sleepeth and the lady fair.\nSlowly they sail, slowly as icy isle\nUpon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile\nThe mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks\nOn heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks\nTo divine powers: from his hand full fain\nJuno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:\nHe tries the nerve of Phoebus' golden bow,\nAnd asketh where the golden apples grow:\nUpon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,\nAnd strives in vain to unsettle and wield\nA Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings\nA full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings\nAnd tantalizes long; at last he drinks,\nAnd lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,\nTouching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.\nHe blows a bugle,\u2014an ethereal band\nAre visible above: the Seasons four,\u2014\nIn Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,\nJoin dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,\nIn swells unmitigated, still doth last\nTo sway their floating morris. \"Whose is this?\nWhose bugle?\" he inquires: they smile\u2014\"O Dis!\nWhy is this mortal here? Dost thou not know\nIts mistress' lips? Not thou?\u2014'Tis Dian's: lo!\nShe rises crescented!\" He looks, 'tis she,\nHis very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,\nAnd air, and pains, and care, and suffering;\nGood-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring\nTowards her, and awakes\u2014and, strange, o'erhead,\nOf those same fragrant exhalations bred,\nBeheld awake his very dream: the gods\nStood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;\nAnd Phoebe bends towards him crescented.\nO state perplexing! On the pinion bed,\nToo well awake, he feels the panting side\nOf his delicious lady. He who died\nFor soaring too audacious in the sun,\nWhere that same treacherous wax began to run,\nFelt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.\nHis heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,\nTo that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way\u2014\nAh, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!\nSo fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,\nAwhile forgetful of all beauty save\nYoung Phoebe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave\nForgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look\nAt the sweet sleeper,\u2014all his soul was shook,\u2014\nShe press'd his hand in slumber; so once more\nAt this the shadow wept, melting away.\nThe Latmian started up: \"Bright goddess, stay!\nSearch my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,\nI have no d\u00e6dale heart: why is it wrung\nTo desperation? Is there nought for me,\nUpon the bourne of bliss, but misery?\"\nThese words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:\nHer dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses\nWith 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.\n\"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe\nThis murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st\nPillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st\nWhat horrors may discomfort thee and me.\nAh, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!\u2014\nYet did she merely weep\u2014her gentle soul\nHath no revenge in it: as it is whole\nIn tenderness, would I were whole in love!\nCan I prize thee, fair maid, all price above,\nEven when I feel as true as innocence?\nI do, I do.\u2014What is this soul then? Whence\nCame it? It does not seem my own, and I\nHave no self-passion or identity.\nSome fearful end must be: where, where is it?\nBy Nemesis, I see my spirit flit\nAlone about the dark\u2014Forgive me, sweet:\nShall we away?\" He rous'd the steeds: they beat\nTheir wings chivalrous into the clear air,\nLeaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.\nThe good-night blush of eve was waning slow,\nAnd Vesper, risen star, began to throe\nIn the dusk heavens silvery, when they\nThus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.\nNor did speed hinder converse soft and strange\u2014\nEternal oaths and vows they interchange,\nIn such wise, in such temper, so aloof\nUp in the winds, beneath a starry roof,\nSo witless of their doom, that verily\n'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;\nWhether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd\u2014\nMost like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.\nFull facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,\nThe moon put forth a little diamond peak,\nNo bigger than an unobserved star,\nOr tiny point of fairy scymetar;\nBright signal that she only stoop'd to tie\nHer silver sandals, ere deliciously\nShe bow'd into the heavens her timid head.\nSlowly she rose, as though she would have fled,\nWhile to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,\nTo mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd\nThis beauty in its birth\u2014Despair! despair!\nHe saw her body fading gaunt and spare\nIn the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;\nIt melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,\nAnd, horror! kiss'd his own\u2014he was alone.\nHer steed a little higher soar'd, and then\nDropt hawkwise to the earth.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There lies a den,\nBeyond the seeming confines of the space\nMade for the soul to wander in and trace\nIts own existence, of remotest glooms.\nDark regions are around it, where the tombs\nOf buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce\nOne hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce\nOf new-born woe it feels more inly smart:\nAnd in these regions many a venom'd dart\nAt random flies; they are the proper home\nOf every ill: the man is yet to come\nWho hath not journeyed in this native hell.\nBut few have ever felt how calm and well\nSleep may be had in that deep den of all.\nThere anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:\nWoe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,\nYet all is still within and desolate.\nBeset with painful gusts, within ye hear\nNo sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier\nThe death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none\nWho strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.\nJust when the sufferer begins to burn,\nThen it is free to him; and from an urn,\nStill fed by melting ice, he takes a draught\u2014\nYoung Semele such richness never quaft\nIn her maternal longing. Happy gloom!\nDark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom\nOf health by due; where silence dreariest\nIs most articulate; where hopes infest;\nWhere those eyes are the brightest far that keep\nTheir lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.\nO happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!\nPregnant with such a den to save the whole\nIn thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!\nFor, never since thy griefs and woes began,\nHast thou felt so content: a grievous feud\nHath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.\nAye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne\nWith dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn\nBecause he knew not whither he was going.\nSo happy was he, not the aerial blowing\nOf trumpets at clear parley from the east\nCould rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.\nThey stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm\nHe flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm\nCould lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd\nA skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,\u2014\nAnd silvery was its passing: voices sweet\nWarbling the while as if to lull and greet\nThe wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,\nWhile past the vision went in bright array.\n\"Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?\nFor all the golden bowers of the day\nAre empty left? Who, who away would be\nFrom Cynthia's wedding and festivity?\nNot Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings\nHe leans away for highest heaven and sings,\nSnapping his lucid fingers merrily!\u2014\nAh, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!\nYe tender bibbers of the rain and dew,\nYoung playmates of the rose and daffodil,\nBe careful, ere ye enter in, to fill\nYour baskets high\nWith fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,\nSavory, latter-mint, and columbines,\nCool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;\nYea, every flower and leaf of every clime,\nAll gather'd in the dewy morning: hie\nAway! fly, fly!\u2014\nCrystalline brother of the belt of heaven,\nAquarius! to whom king Jove has given\nTwo liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,\nTwo fan-like fountains,\u2014thine illuminings\nFor Dian play:\nDissolve the frozen purity of air;\nLet thy white shoulders silvery and bare\nShew cold through watery pinions; make more bright\nThe Star-Queen's crescent on her marriage night:\nHaste, haste away!\u2014\nCastor has tamed the planet Lion, see!\nAnd of the Bear has Pollux mastery:\nA third is in the race! who is the third,\nSpeeding away swift as the eagle bird?\nThe ramping Centaur!\nThe Lion's mane's on end: the Bear how fierce!\nThe Centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce\nSome enemy: far forth his bow is bent\nInto the blue of heaven.

Where?\u2014who? who\nLeft thee so quiet on this bed of dew?\nBehold upon this happy earth we are;\nLet us ay love each other; let us fare\nOn forest-fruits, and never, never go\nAmong the abodes of mortals here below,\nOr be by phantoms duped. O destiny!\nInto a labyrinth now my soul would fly,\nBut with thy beauty will I deaden it.\nWhere didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit\nFor ever: let our fate stop here\u2014a kid\nI on this spot will offer: Pan will bid\nUs live in peace, in love and peace among\nHis forest wildernesses. I have clung\nTo nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen\nOr felt but a great dream! O I have been\nPresumptuous against love, against the sky,\nAgainst all elements, against the tie\nOf mortals each to each, against the blooms\nOf flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs\nOf heroes gone! Against his proper glory\nHas my own soul conspired: so my story\nWill I to children utter, and repent.\nThere never liv'd a mortal man, who bent\nHis appetite beyond his natural sphere,\nBut starv'd and died. My sweetest Indian, here,\nHere will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast\nMy life from too thin breathing: gone and past\nAre cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!\nAnd air of visions, and the monstrous swell\nOf visionary seas! No, never more\nShall airy voices cheat me to the shore\nOf tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.\nAdieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast\nMy love is still for thee. The hour may come\nWhen we shall meet in pure elysium.\nOn earth I may not love thee; and therefore\nAll through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine\nOn me, and on this damsel fair of mine,\nAnd bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!\nMy river-lily bud! one human kiss!\nOne sigh of real breath\u2014one gentle squeeze,\nWarm as a dove's nest among summer trees,\nAnd warm with dew at ooze from living blood!\nWhither didst melt? Ah, what of that!\u2014all good\nWe'll talk about\u2014no more of dreaming.\u2014Now,\nWhere shall our dwelling be? Under the brow\nOf some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun\nWould hide us up, although spring leaves were none;\nAnd where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,\nWill drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?\nO thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;\nDusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace\nThose gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:\nFor by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,\nAnd by another, in deep dell below,\nSee, through the trees, a little river go\nAll in its mid-day gold and glimmering.\nHoney from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,\nAnd apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,\u2014\nCresses that grow where no man may them see,\nAnd sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:\nPipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,\nThat thou mayst always know whither I roam,\nWhen it shall please thee in our quiet home\nTo listen and think of love. Still let me speak;\nStill let me dive into the joy I seek,\u2014\nFor yet the past doth prison me. The rill,\nThou haply mayst delight in, will I fill\nWith fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,\nAnd thou shalt feed them from the squirrel's barn.\nIts bottom will I strew with amber shells,\nAnd pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.\nIts sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,\nAnd honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.\nI will entice this crystal rill to trace\nLove's silver name upon the meadow's face.\nI'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;\nAnd to god Phoebus, for a golden lyre;\nTo Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;\nTo Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,\nThat I may see thy beauty through the night;\nTo Flora, and a nightingale shall light\nTame on thy finger; to the River-gods,\nAnd they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods\nOf gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.\nHeaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!\nThy mossy footstool shall the altar be\n'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:\nThose lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak\nLaws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,\nTrembling or stedfastness to this same voice,\nAnd of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:\nAnd that affectionate light, those diamond things,\nThose eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,\nShall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.\nSay, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?\nO that I could not doubt?\"\nThe mountaineer\nThus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear\nHis briar'd path to some tranquillity.\nIt gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,\nAnd yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;\nAnswering thus, just as the golden morrow\nBeam'd upward from the vallies of the east:\n\"O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,\nOr the sweet name of love had pass'd away.\nYoung feather'd tyrant! by a swift decay\nWilt thou devote this body to the earth:\nAnd I do think that at my very birth\nI lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;\nFor at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,\nWith uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.\nArt thou not cruel? Ever have I striven\nTo think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!\nWhen yet a child, I heard that kisses drew\nFavour from thee, and so I kisses gave\nTo the void air, bidding them find out love:\nBut when I came to feel how far above\nAll fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,\nAll earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,\nWas the warm tremble of a devout kiss,\u2014\nEven then, that moment, at the thought of this,\nFainting I fell into a bed of flowers,\nAnd languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,\nAm I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe\nMe, dear Endymion, were I to weave\nWith my own fancies garlands of sweet life,\nThou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!\nI may not be thy love: I am forbidden\u2014\nIndeed I am\u2014thwarted, affrighted, chidden,\nBy things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.\nTwice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth\nAsk me no more! I may not utter it,\nNor may I be thy love. We might commit\nOurselves at once to vengeance; we might die;\nWe might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!\nEnlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught\nIn trammels of perverse deliciousness.\nNo, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,\nAnd bid a long adieu.\"\nThe Carian\nNo word return'd: both lovelorn, silent, wan,\nInto the vallies green together went.\nFar wandering, they were perforce content\nTo sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;\nNor at each other gaz'd, but heavily\nPor'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.\nEndymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves\nMe to behold thee thus in last extreme:\nEnsky'd ere this, but truly that I deem\nTruth the best music in a first-born song.\nThy lute-voic'd brother will I sing ere long,\nAnd thou shalt aid\u2014hast thou not aided me?\nYes, moonlight Emperor! felicity\nHas been thy meed for many thousand years;\nYet often have I, on the brink of tears,\nMourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester,\u2014\nForgetting the old tale.\nHe did not stir\nHis eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse\nOf joy he might have felt.

The teeming tree\nHad swollen and green'd the pious charactery,\nBut not ta'en out. Why, there was not a slope\nUp which he had not fear'd the antelope;\nAnd not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade\nHe had not with his tamed leopards play'd.\nNor could an arrow light, or javelin,\nFly in the air where his had never been\u2014\nAnd yet he knew it not.\nO treachery!\nWhy does his lady smile, pleasing her eye\nWith all his sorrowing?

Thou alone,\nPeona, mayst return to me. I own\nThis may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,\nThou seest it for my happiness, no pearl\nWill trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!\nWilt be content to dwell with her, to share\nThis sister's love with me?\" Like one resign'd\nAnd bent by circumstance, and thereby blind\nIn self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:\n\"Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,\nOf jubilee to Dian:\u2014truth I heard!\nWell then, I see there is no little bird,\nTender soever, but is Jove's own care.\nLong have I sought for rest, and, unaware,\nBehold I find it! so exalted too!\nSo after my own heart! I knew, I knew\nThere was a place untenanted in it:\nIn that same void white Chastity shall sit,\nAnd monitor me nightly to lone slumber.\nWith sanest lips I vow me to the number\nOf Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,\nMy future days to her fane consecrate.\"\nAs feels a dreamer what doth most create\nHis own particular fright, so these three felt:\nOr like one who, in after ages, knelt\nTo Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine\nAfter a little sleep: or when in mine\nFar under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends\nWho know him not. Each diligently bends\nTowards common thoughts and things for very fear;\nStriving their ghastly malady to cheer,\nBy thinking it a thing of yes and no,\nThat housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow\nWas struck, and all were dreamers. At the last\nEndymion said: \"Are not our fates all cast?\nWhy stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!\nAdieu!\" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,\nWalk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot\nHis eyes went after them, until they got\nNear to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,\nIn one swift moment, would what then he saw\nEngulph for ever. \"Stay!\" he cried, \"ah, stay!\nTurn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.\nSweet Indian, I would see thee once again.\nIt is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,\nPeona, ye should hand in hand repair\nInto those holy groves, that silent are\nBehind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,\nAt vesper's earliest twinkle\u2014they are gone\u2014\nBut once, once, once again\u2014\" At this he press'd\nHis hands against his face, and then did rest\nHis head upon a mossy hillock green,\nAnd so remain'd as he a corpse had been\nAll the long day; save when he scantly lifted\nHis eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted\nWith the slow move of time,\u2014sluggish and weary\nUntil the poplar tops, in journey dreary,\nHad reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,\nAnd, slowly as that very river flows,\nWalk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:\n\"Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent\nCareful and soft, that not a leaf may fall\nBefore the serene father of them all\nBows down his summer head below the west.\nNow am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,\nBut at the setting I must bid adieu\nTo her for the last time. Night will strew\nOn the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,\nAnd with them shall I die; nor much it grieves\nTo die, when summer dies on the cold sward.\nWhy, I have been a butterfly, a lord\nOf flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,\nGroves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;\nMy kingdom's at its death, and just it is\nThat I should die with it: so in all this\nWe miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,\nWhat is there to plain of? By Titan's foe\nI am but rightly serv'd.\" So saying, he\nTripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;\nLaughing at the clear stream and setting sun,\nAs though they jests had been: nor had he done\nHis laugh at nature's holy countenance,\nUntil that grove appear'd, as if perchance,\nAnd then his tongue with sober seemlihed\nGave utterance as he entered: \"Ha!\" I said,\n\"King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,\nAnd by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,\nThis dusk religion, pomp of solitude,\nAnd the Promethean clay by thief endued,\nBy old Saturnus' forelock, by his head\nShook with eternal palsy, I did wed\nMyself to things of light from infancy;\nAnd thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,\nIs sure enough to make a mortal man\nGrow impious.\" So he inwardly began\nOn things for which no wording can be found;\nDeeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd\nBeyond the reach of music: for the choir\nOf Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar\nNor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull\nThe vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,\nThrough the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.\nHe saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,\nWan as primroses gather'd at midnight\nBy chilly finger'd spring. \"Unhappy wight!\nEndymion!\" said Peona, \"we are here!\nWhat wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?\"\nThen he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand\nPress'd, saying:\" Sister, I would have command,\nIf it were heaven's will, on our sad fate.\"\nAt which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate\nAnd said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,\nTo Endymion's amaze: \"By Cupid's dove,\nAnd so thou shalt! and by the lily truth\nOf my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!\"\nAnd as she spake, into her face there came\nLight, as reflected from a silver flame:\nHer long black hair swell'd ampler, in display\nFull golden; in her eyes a brighter day\nDawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld\nPhoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld\nHer lucid bow, continuing thus; \"Drear, drear\nHas our delaying been; but foolish fear\nWithheld me first; and then decrees of fate;\nAnd then 'twas fit that from this mortal state\nThou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change\nBe spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range\nThese forests, and to thee they safe shall be\nAs was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee\nTo meet us many a time.\" Next Cynthia bright\nPeona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:\nHer brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown\nBefore his goddess, in a blissful swoon.\nShe gave her fair hands to him, and behold,\nBefore three swiftest kisses he had told,\nThey vanish'd far away!\u2014Peona went\nHome through the gloomy wood in wonderment.\n(line 2): This line originally began with 'O Mountain-born in the draft, where also 'while' stands cancelled in favour of 'by.'\n(line 158): Keats has been supposed to have invented the variant 'spry' for 'spray' for convenience of rhyming, just as Shelley has been accused of inventing for like reasons the word 'uprest', for example, in Laon And Cythna, Canto III, Stanza xxi. Sandys, the translator of Ovid, may not be a very good authority; but he is not improbably Keats's authority for 'spry', and will certainly do in default of a better.\n(line 273): The biblical dissyllabic form 'mayest' is clearly used by deliberate preference, for the line originally stood thus in the draft :\nAnd I have told thee all that thou canst hear.\n(line 298): Remember'd from its velvet summer song : The gentleness of summer wind seems to have been a cherished idea with Keats.  Compare with Sleep And Poetry, line 1 --\n'What is more gentle than a wind in summer?'\n(line 585): This was originally a short line consisting of the words \"Thine illuminings\" alone. The whole stanza, ... was sent by Keats to his friend Baily for his \"vote, pro or con,\" in a letter dated the 22nd of November 1817.\n(line 668): An imagination in which Hunt would have found it difficult to discover the reality; but probably Keats had never seen the miserable platform of dry twigs that serves for \"a dove's nest among summer trees.\"\n(line 672): Endymion's imaginary home and employments as pictured in the next fifty lines may be compared with Shelley's AEgean island described so wonderfully in Epipsychidion. Both passages are thoroughly characteristic; and they show the divergence between the modes of thought and sentiment of the two men in a very marked way.\n(line 885-86): A curious importation from Hebrew theology into a subject from Greek mythology. Compare St. Matthew, X, 29: \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.\" Or, as made familiar to our childhood by the popular hymn-wright,---\n'A little sparrow cannot fall,\nUnnoticed, Lord, by Thee.'\nIn the finished manuscript the word \"kist\" occurs twice instead of \"kiss'd\" as in the first edition; but \"bless'd\" is not similarly transformed to \"blest.\"\nAt the end of the draft Keats wrote \"Burford Bridge Nov. 28, 1817--\".\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Endymion:-Book-IV"}
{"title": "Epistle To John Hamilton Reynolds", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Dear Reynolds, as last night I lay in bed,\nThere came before my eyes that wonted thread\nOf shapes, and shadows, and remembrances,\nThat every other minute vex and please:\nThings all disjointed come from north and south,--\nTwo witch's eyes above a cherub's mouth,\nVoltaire with casque and shield and habergeon,\nAnd Alexander with his nightcap on;\nOld Socrates a-tying his cravat,\nAnd Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat;\nAnd Junius Brutus, pretty well so-so,\nMaking the best of's way towards Soho.\nFew are there who escape these visitings--\nPerhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings,\nAnd through whose curtains peeps no hellish nose,\nNo wild-boar tushes, and no mermaid's toes;\nBut flowers bursting out with lusty pride,\nAnd young AEolian harps personified;\nSome Titian colours touch'd into real life,--\nThe sacrifice goes on; the pontiff knife\nGleams in the sun, the milk-white heifer lows,\nThe pipes go shrilly, the libation flows:\nA white sail shows above the green-head cliff,\nMoves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff;\nThe mariners join hymn with those on land.\nYou know the Enchanted Castle -- it doth stand\nUpon a rock on the border of a lake,\nNested in trees, which all do seem to shake\nFrom some old magic like Urganda's sword.\nO Phoebus! that I had thy sacred word\nTo show this Castle in fair dreaming wise\nUnto my friend, while sick and ill he lies!\nYou know it well enough, where it doth seem\nA mossy place, a Merlin's Hall, a dream;\nYou know the clear lake, and the little isles,\nThe mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills--\nAll which elsewhere are but half animate,\nHere do they look alive to love and hate,\nTo smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound\nAbove some giant, pulsing underground.\nPart of the building was a chosen See\nBuilt by a banish'd Santon of Chaldee;\nThe other part, two thousand years from him,\nWas built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim;\nThen there's a little wing, far from the sun,\nBuilt by a Lapland witch turn'd maudlin nun;\nAnd many other juts of aged stone\nFounded with many a mason-devil's groan.\nThe doors all look as if they op'd themselves,\nThe windows as if latch'd by fays and elves,\nAnd from them comes a silver flash of light\nAs from the westward of a summer's night;\nOr like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes\nGone mad through olden songs and poesies.\nSee what is coming from the distance dim!\nA golden galley all in silken trim!\nThree rows of oars are lightening, moment whiles,\nInto the verdurous bosoms of those isles;\nTowards the shade under the Castle wall\nIt comes in silence -- now 'tis hidden all.\nThe clarion sounds, and from a postern-gate\nAn echo of sweet music doth create\nA fear in the poor herdsman who doth bring\nHis beasts to trouble the enchanted spring,--\nHe tells of the sweet music and the spot\nTo all his friends, and they believe him not.\nO that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,\nWould all their colours from the sunset take:\nFrom something of material sublime,\nRather than shadow our own soul's day-time\nIn the dark void of night. For in the world\nWe jostle- but my flag is not unfurl'd\nOn the Admiral-staff -- and to philosophize\nI dare not yet! Oh, never will the prize,\nHigh reason, and the lore of good and ill,\nBe my award! Things cannot to the will\nBe settled, but they tease us out of thought;\nOr is it that Imagination brought\nBeyond its proper bound, yet still confin'd,\nLost in a sort of Purgatory blind,\nCannot refer to any standard law\nOf either earth or heaven? It is a flaw\nIn happiness to see beyond our bourn,--\nIt forces us in summer skies to mourn,\nIt spoils the singing of the Nightingale.\nDear Reynolds! I have a mysterious tale\nAnd cannot speak it. The first page I read\nUpon a lampit rock of green sea-weed\nAmong the breakers; 'twas a quiet eve,\nThe rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave\nAn untumultuous fringe of silver foam\nAlong the flat brown sand; I was at home\nAnd should have been most happy,-- but I saw\nToo far into the sea, where every maw\nThe greater on the less feeds evermore.--\nBut I saw too distinct into the core\nOf an eternal fierce destruction,\nAnd so from happiness I far was gone.\nStill am I sick of it, and though to-day\nI've gather'd young spring-leaves, and flowers gay\nOf periwinkle and wild strawberry,\nStill do I that most fierce destruction see,--\nThe Shark at savage prey, the Hawk at pounce,--\nThe gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce,\nRavening a worm -- Away, ye horrid moods!\nMoods of one's mind! You know I hate them well.\nYou know I'd sooner be a clapping Bell\nTo some Kamschatcan Missionary Church,\nThan with these horrid moods be left i' the lurch.\nDo you get health -- and Tom the same -- I'll dance,\nAnd from detested moods in new Romance\nTake refuge. Of bad lines a Centaine dose\n'This epistle with a few lines of introduction in prose was written at Teignmouth, and is dated the 25 of March 1818 in the Life, Letters &c. where it first appeared. Keats says to his friend --\n\"In hopes of cheering you through a minute or two, I was determined, will he nill he, to send you some lines, so you will excuse the unconnected subject and careless verse. You know, I am sure, Claude's 'Enchanted Castle,' and I wish you may be pleased with my remembrance of it.\"\nSome thirty years ago this picture emerged from Lord Overstone's collection at Wickham Park, Bromley, and was exhibited at the British Institution. It was a favourite in Keats's circle. Hunt, in Imagination and Fancy, says of the \"perilous seas in faery lands forlorn\" passage in the Ode to a Nightingale, \"This beats Claude's Enchanted Castle, and the story of King Beder in the Arabian Nights.\"'\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

{"title": "Epistle To My Brother George", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Full many a dreary hour have I past,\nMy brain bewildered, and my mind o'ercast\nWith heaviness; in seasons when I've thought\nNo spherey strains by me could e'er be caught\nFrom the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze\nOn the far depth where sheeted lightning plays;\nOr, on the wavy grass outstretched supinely,\nPry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely:\nThat I should never hear Apollo's song,\nThough feathery clouds were floating all along\nThe purple west, and, two bright streaks between,\nThe golden lyre itself were dimly seen:\nThat the still murmur of the honey bee\nWould never teach a rural song to me:\nThat the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting\nWould never make a lay of mine enchanting,\nOr warm my breast with ardour to unfold\nSome tale of love and arms in time of old.\nBut there are times, when those that love the bay,\nFly from all sorrowing far, far away;\nA sudden glow comes on them, nought they see\nIn water, earth, or air, but poesy.\nIt has been said, dear George, and true I hold it,\n(For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,)\nThat when a Poet is in such a trance,\nIn air her sees white coursers paw, and prance,\nBestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel,\nWho at each other tilt in playful quarrel,\nAnd what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,\nIs the swift opening of their wide portal,\nWhen the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,\nWhose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear.\nWhen these enchanted portals open wide,\nAnd through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,\nThe Poet's eye can reach those golden halls,\nAnd view the glory of their festivals:\nTheir ladies fair, that in the distance seem\nFit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;\nTheir rich brimmed goblets, that incessant run\nLike the bright spots that move about the sun;\nAnd, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar\nPours with the lustre of a falling star.\nYet further off, are dimly seen their bowers,\nOf which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;\nAnd 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows\n'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose.\nAll that's revealed from that far seat of blisses\nIs the clear fountains' interchanging kisses,\nAs gracefully descending, light and thin,\nLike silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,\nWhen he upswimmeth from the coral caves,\nAnd sports with half his tail above the waves.\nThese wonders strange he sees, and many more,\nWhose head is pregnant with poetic lore.\nShould he upon an evening ramble fare\nWith forehead to the soothing breezes bare,\nWould he nought see but the dark, silent blue\nWith all its diamonds trembling through and through?\nOr the coy moon, when in the waviness\nOf whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,\nAnd staidly paces higher up, and higher,\nLike a sweet nun in holy-day attire?\nAh, yes! much more would start into his sight\u2014\nThe revelries and mysteries of night:\nAnd should I ever see them, I will tell you\nSuch tales as needs must with amazement spell you.\nThese are the living pleasures of the bard:\nBut richer far posterity's reward.\nWhat does he murmur with his latest breath,\nWhile his proud eye looks though the film of death?\n\"What though I leave this dull and earthly mould,\nYet shall my spirit lofty converse hold\nWith after times.\u2014The patriot shall feel\nMy stern alarum, and unsheath his steel;\nOr, in the senate thunder out my numbers\nTo startle princes from their easy slumbers.\nThe sage will mingle with each moral theme\nMy happy thoughts sententious; he will teem\nWith lofty periods when my verses fire him,\nAnd then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him.\nLays have I left of such a dear delight\nThat maids will sing them on their bridal night.\nGay villagers, upon a morn of May,\nWhen they have tired their gentle limbs with play\nAnd formed a snowy circle on the grass,\nAnd placed in midst of all that lovely lass\nWho chosen is their queen,\u2014with her fine head\nCrowned with flowers purple, white, and red:\nFor there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,\nAre emblems true of hapless lovers dying:\nBetween her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,\nA bunch of violets full blown, and double,\nSerenely sleep:\u2014she from a casket takes\nA little book,\u2014and then a joy awakes\nAbout each youthful heart,\u2014with stifled cries,\nAnd rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes:\nFor she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;\nOne that I fostered in my youthful years:\nThe pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,\nMust ever and anon with silent creep,\nLured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest\nShall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,\nBe lulled with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!\nThy dales, and hills, are fading from my view:\nSwiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions,\nFar from the narrow bound of thy dominions.\nFull joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,\nThat my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,\nAnd warm thy sons!\" Ah, my dear friend and brother,\nCould I, at once, my mad ambition smother,\nFor tasting joys like these, sure I should be\nHappier, and dearer to society.\nAt times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain\nWhen some bright thought has darted through my brain:\nThrough all that day I've felt a greater pleasure\nThan if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure.\nAs to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,\nI feel delighted, still, that you should read them.\nOf late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment,\nStretched on the grass at my best loved employment\nOf scribbling lines for you. These things I thought\nWhile, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught.\nE'en now I'm pillowed on a bed of flowers\nThat crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers\nAbove the ocean-waves, The stalks, and blades,\nChequer my tablet with their quivering shades.\nOn one side is a field of drooping oats,\nThrough which the poppies show their scarlet coats;\nSo pert and useless, that they bring to mind\nThe scarlet coats that pester human-kind.\nAnd on the other side, outspread, is seen\nOcean's blue mantle streaked with purple, and green.\nNow 'tis I see a canvassed ship, and now\nMark the bright silver curling round her prow.\nI see the lark dowm-dropping to his nest,\nAnd the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;\nFor when no more he spreads his feathers free,\nHis breast is dancing on the restless sea.\nNow I direct my eyes into the west,\nWhich at this moment is in sunbeams drest:\nWhy westward turn?

O that my known voice\nCould reach your dastard ears, and fright you more!\nFly, cowards, fly! Glocester is at your backs!\nThrow your slack bridles o'er the flurried manes,\nPly well the rowel with faint trembling heels,\nScampering to death at last!\nFirst Knight. The enemy\nBears his flaunt standard close upon their rear.\nSecond Knight. Sure of a bloody prey, seeing the fens\nWill swamp them girth-deep.\nStephen. Over head and ears,\nNo matter! 'Tis a gallant enemy;\nHow like a comet he goes streaming on.\nBut we must plague him in the flank, hey, friends?\nEnter Earl BALDWIN and Soldiers, as defeated.\nStephen.

No scare-crow, but the fortunate star\nOf boisterous Chester, whose fell truncheon now\nPoints level to the goal of victory.\nThis way he comes, and if you would maintain\nYour person unaffronted by vile odds,\nTake horse, my Lord.\nStephen. And which way spur for life?\nNow I thank Heaven I am in the toils,\nThat soldiers may bear witness how my arm\nCan burst the meshes. Not the eagle more\nLoves to beat up against a tyrannous blast,\nThan I to meet the torrent of my foes.\nThis is a brag, be 't so, but if I fall,\nCarve it upon my 'scutcheon'd sepulchre.\nOn, fellow soldiers!

Will Stephen's death be marked there, my good\nLord,\nOr that we gave him lodging in yon towers?\nGlocester. Fain would I know the great usurper's fate.\nEnter two Captains severally.\nFirst Captain. My Lord!\nSecond Captain. Most noble Earl!\nFirst Captain. The King\nSecond Captain. The Empress greets\nGlocester. What of the King?\nFirst Captain. He sole and lone maintains\nA hopeless bustle mid our swarming arms,\nAnd with a nimble savageness attacks,\nEscapes, makes fiercer onset, then anew\nEludes death, giving death to most that dare\nTrespass within the circuit of his sword!\nHe must by this have fallen.

From Stephen, my good Prince, Stephen!\nStephen!\nGlocester. Why do you make such echoing of his name?\nSecond Knight. Because I think, my lord, he is no man,\nBut a fierce demon, Anointed safe from wounds,\nAnd misbaptized with a Christian name.\nGlocester. A mighty soldier! Does he still hold out?\nSecond Knight. He shames our victory. His valour still\nKeeps elbow-room amid our eager swords,\nAnd holds our bladed falchions all aloof\nHis gleaming battle-axe being slaughter-sick,\nSmote on the morion of a Flemish knight,\nBroke short in his hand; upon the which he flung\nThe heft away with such a vengeful force,\nIt paunch'd the Earl of Chester's horse, who then\nSpleen-hearted came in full career at him.\nGlocester. Did no one take him at a vantage then?\nSecond Knight. Three then with tiger leap upon him flew,\nWhom, with his sword swift-drawn and nimbly held,\nHe stung away again, and stood to breathe,\nSmiling. Anon upon him rush'd once more\nA throng of foes, and in this renew'd strife,\nMy sword met his and snapp'd off at the hilts.\nGlocester.

Do it, De Kaims, I will not budge an inch.\nDe Kaims. Yes, of thy madness thou shalt take the meed.\nStephen. Darest thou?\nDe Kaims. How dare, against a man disarmed?\nStephen. What weapons has the lion but himself?\nCome not near me, De Kaims, for by the price\nOf all the glory I have won this day,\nBeing a king, I will not yield alive\nTo any but the second man of the realm,\nRobert of Glocester.\nDe Kaims. Thou shalt vail to me.\nStephen. Shall I, when I have sworn against it, sir?\nThou think'st it brave to take a breathing king,\nThat, on a court-day bow'd to haughty Maud,\nThe awed presence-chamber may be bold\nTo whisper, there's the man who took alive\nStephen me prisoner. Certes, De Kaims,\nThe ambition is a noble one.\nDe Kaims. 'Tis true,\nAnd, Stephen, I must compass it.\nStephen. No, no,\nDo not tempt me to throttle you on the gorge,\nOr with my gauntlet crush your hollow breast,\nJust when your knighthood is grown ripe and full\nFor lordship.\nA Soldier. Is an honest yeoman's spear\nOf no use at a need? Take that.\nStephen. Ah, dastard!\nDe Kaims. What, you are vulnerable! my prisoner I\nStephen. No, not yet. I disclaim it, and demand\nDeath as a sovereign right unto a king\nWho 'sdains to yield to any but his peer,\nIf not in title, yet in noble deeds,\nThe Earl of Glocester.

Queen MAUD in a Chair of State, the\nEarls of GLOCESTER and CHESTER, Lords, Attendants.\nMaud. Glocester, no more: I will behold that Boulogne:\nSet him before me. Not for the poor sake\nOf regal pomp and a vain-glorious hour,\nAs thou with wary speech, yet near enough,\nHast hinted.\nGlocester. Faithful counsel have I given ;\nIf wary, for your Highness' benefit.\nMaud. The Heavens forbid that I should not think so,\nFor by thy valour have I won this realm,\nWhich by thy wisdom I will ever keep.\nTo sage advisers let me ever bend\n\"A meek attentive ear, so that they treat\nOf the wide kingdom's rule and government,\nNot trenching on our actions personal.\nAdvis'd, not school'd, I would be; and henceforth\nSpoken to in clear, plain, and open terms,\nNot side-ways sermon'd at.\nGlocester. Then, in plain terms,\nOnce more for the fallen king\nMaud. Your pardon, Brother,\nI would no more of that; for, as I said,\n\u2018Tis not for worldly pomp I wish to see\nThe rebel, but as dooming judge to give\nA sentence something worthy of his guilt.\nGlocester. If 't must be so, I'll bring him to your presence.\n[Exit GLOCESTER,\nMaud. A meaner summoner might do as well\nMy Lord of Chester, is 't true what I hear\nOf Stephen of Boulogne, our prisoner,\nThat he, as a fit penance for his crimes,\nEats wholesome, sweet, and palatable food\nOff Glocester's golden dishes drinks pure wine,\nLodgest soft?\nChester. More than that, my gracious Queen,\nHas anger'd me. The noble Earl, methinks,\nFull soldier as he is, and without peer\nIn counsel, dreams too much among his books.\nIt may read well, but sure 'tis out of date\nTo play the Alexander with Darius.\nMaud. Truth! I think so. By Heavens it shall not last!\nChester. It would amaze your Highness now to mark\nHow Glocester overstrains his courtesy\nTo that crime-loving rebel, that Boulogne\nMaud. That ingrate!\nChester. For whose vast ingratitude\nTo our late sovereign lord, your noble sire,\nThe generous Earl condoles in his mishaps,\nAnd with a sort of lackeying friendliness,\nTalks off the mighty frowning from his brow,\nWoos him to hold a duet in a smile,\nOr, if it please him, play an hour at chess\nMaud. A perjured slave!\nChester. And for his perjury,\nGlocester has fit rewards nay, I believe,\nHe sets his bustling household's wits at work\nFor flatteries to ease this Stephen's hours,\nAnd make a heaven of his purgatory ;\nAdorning bondage with the pleasant gloss\nOf feasts and music, and all idle shows\nOf indoor pageantry; while syren whispers,\nPredestined for his ear, 'scape as half-check'd\nFrom lips the courtliest and the rubiest\nOf all the realm, admiring of his deeds.\nMaud. A frost upon his summer!\nChester. A queen's nod\nCan make his June December.

Listen then!\n\u201cWhat mortal hath a prize, that other men\n\u201cMay be confounded and abash\u2019d withal,\n\u201cBut lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,\n\u201cAnd triumph, as in thee I should rejoice\n\u201cAmid the hoarse alarm of Corinth\u2019s voice.\n\u201cLet my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,\n\u201cWhile through the thronged streets your bridal car\n\u201cWheels round its dazzling spokes.\u201d\u2014The lady\u2019s cheek\nTrembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,\nArose and knelt before him, wept a rain\nOf sorrows at his words; at last with pain\nBeseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,\nTo change his purpose. He thereat was stung,\nPerverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim\nHer wild and timid nature to his aim:\nBesides, for all his love, in self despite,\nAgainst his better self, he took delight\nLuxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.\nHis passion, cruel grown, took on a hue\nFierce and sanguineous as \u2019twas possible\nIn one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.\nFine was the mitigated fury, like\nApollo\u2019s presence when in act to strike\nThe serpent\u2014Ha, the serpent! certes, she\nWas none. She burnt, she lov\u2019d the tyranny,\nAnd, all subdued, consented to the hour\nWhen to the bridal he should lead his paramour.\nWhispering in midnight silence, said the youth,\n\u201cSure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,\n\u201cI have not ask\u2019d it, ever thinking thee\n\u201cNot mortal, but of heavenly progeny,\n\u201cAs still I do. Hast any mortal name,\n\u201cFit appellation for this dazzling frame?\n\u201cOr friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,\n\u201cTo share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?\u201d\n\u201cI have no friends,\u201d said Lamia, \u201cno, not one;\n\u201cMy presence in wide Corinth hardly known:\n\u201cMy parents\u2019 bones are in their dusty urns\n\u201cSepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,\n\u201cSeeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,\n\u201cAnd I neglect the holy rite for thee.\n\u201cEven as you list invite your many guests;\n\u201cBut if, as now it seems, your vision rests\n\u201cWith any pleasure on me, do not bid\n\u201cOld Apollonius\u2014from him keep me hid.\u201d\nLycius, perplex\u2019d at words so blind and blank,\nMade close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,\nFeigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade\nOf deep sleep in a moment was betray\u2019d.\nIt was the custom then to bring away\nThe bride from home at blushing shut of day,\nVeil\u2019d, in a chariot, heralded along\nBy strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,\nWith other pageants: but this fair unknown\nHad not a friend. So being left alone,\n(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)\nAnd knowing surely she could never win\nHis foolish heart from its mad pompousness,\nShe set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress\nThe misery in fit magnificence.\nShe did so, but \u2019tis doubtful how and whence\nCame, and who were her subtle servitors.\nAbout the halls, and to and from the doors,\nThere was a noise of wings, till in short space\nThe glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.\nA haunting music, sole perhaps and lone\nSupportress of the faery-roof, made moan\nThroughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.\nFresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade\nOf palm and plantain, met from either side,\nHigh in the midst, in honour of the bride:\nTwo palms and then two plantains, and so on,\nFrom either side their stems branch\u2019d one to one\nAll down the aisled place; and beneath all\nThere ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.\nSo canopied, lay an untasted feast\nTeeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,\nSilently paced about, and as she went,\nIn pale contented sort of discontent,\nMission\u2019d her viewless servants to enrich\nThe fretted splendour of each nook and niche.\nBetween the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,\nCame jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst\nForth creeping imagery of slighter trees,\nAnd with the larger wove in small intricacies.\nApproving all, she faded at self-will,\nAnd shut the chamber up, close, hush\u2019d and still,\nComplete and ready for the revels rude,\nWhen dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.\nThe day appear\u2019d, and all the gossip rout.\nO senseless Lycius!

What for Lycius?\nWhat for the sage, old Apollonius?\nUpon her aching forehead be there hung\nThe leaves of willow and of adder\u2019s tongue;\nAnd for the youth, quick, let us strip for him\nThe thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim\nInto forgetfulness; and, for the sage,\nLet spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage\nWar on his temples. Do not all charms fly\nAt the mere touch of cold philosophy?\nThere was an awful rainbow once in heaven:\nWe know her woof, her texture; she is given\nIn the dull catalogue of common things.\nPhilosophy will clip an Angel\u2019s wings,\nConquer all mysteries by rule and line,\nEmpty the haunted air, and gnomed mine\u2014\nUnweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made\nThe tender-person\u2019d Lamia melt into a shade.\nBy her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,\nScarce saw in all the room another face,\nTill, checking his love trance, a cup he took\nFull brimm\u2019d, and opposite sent forth a look\n\u2019Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance\nFrom his old teacher\u2019s wrinkled countenance,\nAnd pledge him. The bald-head philosopher\nHad fix\u2019d his eye, without a twinkle or stir\nFull on the alarmed beauty of the bride,\nBrow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.\nLycius then press\u2019d her hand, with devout touch,\nAs pale it lay upon the rosy couch:\n\u2019Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;\nThen sudden it grew hot, and all the pains\nOf an unnatural heat shot to his heart.\n\u201cLamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?\n\u201cKnow\u2019st thou that man?\u201d Poor Lamia answer\u2019d not.\nHe gaz\u2019d into her eyes, and not a jot\nOwn\u2019d they the lovelorn piteous appeal:\nMore, more he gaz\u2019d: his human senses reel:\nSome hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;\nThere was no recognition in those orbs.\n\u201cLamia!\u201d he cried\u2014and no soft-toned reply.\nThe many heard, and the loud revelry\nGrew hush; the stately music no more breathes;\nThe myrtle sicken\u2019d in a thousand wreaths.\nBy faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;\nA deadly silence step by step increased,\nUntil it seem\u2019d a horrid presence there,\nAnd not a man but felt the terror in his hair.\n\u201cLamia!\u201d he shriek\u2019d; and nothing but the shriek\nWith its sad echo did the silence break.\n\u201cBegone, foul dream!\u201d he cried, gazing again\nIn the bride\u2019s face, where now no azure vein\nWander\u2019d on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom\nMisted the cheek; no passion to illume\nThe deep-recessed vision:\u2014all was blight;\nLamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white.\n\u201cShut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!\n\u201cTurn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban\n\u201cOf all the Gods, whose dreadful images\n\u201cHere represent their shadowy presences,\n\u201cMay pierce them on the sudden with the thorn\n\u201cOf painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,\n\u201cIn trembling dotage to the feeblest fright\n\u201cOf conscience, for their long offended might,\n\u201cFor all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,\n\u201cUnlawful magic, and enticing lies.\n\u201cCorinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!\n\u201cMark how, possess\u2019d, his lashless eyelids stretch\n\u201cAround his demon eyes! Corinthians, see!\n\u201cMy sweet bride withers at their potency.\u201d\n\u201cFool!\u201d said the sophist, in an under-tone\nGruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan\nFrom Lycius answer\u2019d, as heart-struck and lost,\nHe sank supine beside the aching ghost.\n\u201cFool! Fool!\u201d repeated he, while his eyes still\nRelented not, nor mov\u2019d; \u201cfrom every ill\n\u201cOf life have I preserv\u2019d thee to this day,\n\u201cAnd shall I see thee made a serpent\u2019s prey?\nThen Lamia breath\u2019d death breath; the sophist\u2019s eye,\nLike a sharp spear, went through her utterly,\nKeen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well\nAs her weak hand could any meaning tell,\nMotion\u2019d him to be silent; vainly so,\nHe look\u2019d and look\u2019d again a level--No!\n\u201cA Serpent!\u201d echoed he; no sooner said,\nThan with a frightful scream she vanished:\nAnd Lycius\u2019 arms were empty of delight,\nAs were his limbs of life, from that same night.\nOn the high couch he lay!\u2014his friends came round--\nSupported him\u2014no pulse, or breath they found,\nAnd, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound.\n(line 50): Keats adopted here, in the manuscript, a pointing notice before: he placed the note of interrogation at the end of this line, a semi-colon at the end of line 51, and a full-stop at the end of line 54. The pointing of the text is from the first edition.\n(lines 124-6): Leigh Hunt notes - \"This is the very quintessence of the romantic.\"\n(line 140): Rejected reading, \"wainscoated\" for \"marbled plain.\"\n(line 239): In the Autobiography of Haydon, as edited by the late Mr. Tom Taylor, we read at page 354 of Volume 1 (edition of 1853) that Keats and Lamb, at one of the meetings at Haydon's house, agreed that Newton \"had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow, by reducing it to the prismatic colours.\"  This meeting was what Haydon calls \"the immortal dinner\" of the 28th of December 1817; so that the idea appears to have persisted in Keats's mind.\n\"Philostratus, in his fourth book 'de Vita Apollonii', hath a memorable instance in this kind, which I may not omit, of one Menippus Lycius, a young man twenty-five years of age, that going betwixt Cenchreas and Corinth, met such a phantasm in the habit of a fair gentlewoman, which taking him by the hand, carried him home to her house, in the suburbs of Corinth, and told him she was a Phoenician by birth, and if he would tarry with her, he should hear her sing and play, and drink such wine as never any drank, and no man should molest him; but she, being fair and lovely, would live and die with him, that was fair and lovely to behold.  The young man, a philosopher, otherwise staid and discreet, able to moderate his passions, though not this of love, tarried with her a while to his great content, and at last married her, to whose wedding, amongst other guests, came Apollonius; who, by some probable conjectures, found her out to be a serpent, a lamia; and that all her furniture was, like Tantalus' gold, descried by Homer, no substance but mere illusions. When she saw herself descried, she wept, and desired Apollonius to be silent, but he would not be moved, and thereupon she, plate, house, and all that was in it, vanished in an instant: many thousands took notice of this fact, for it was done in the midst of Greece.\" ~ Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy.'

In a dark & unknown Night,\nOutstretch'd his Giant beauty on the ground in pain & tears:\nPLATE 19\nHis Children exil'd from his breast pass to and fro before him\nHis birds are silent on his hills, flocks die beneath his branches\nHis tents are fall'n! his trumpets, and the sweet sound of his harp\nAre silent on his clouded hills, that belch forth storms & fire.\nHis milk of Cows, & honey of Bees, & fruit of golden harvest, 5\nIs gather'd in the scorching heat, & in the driving rain:\nWhere once he sat he weary walks in misery and pain:\nHis Giant beauty and perfection fallen into dust:\nTill from within his witherd breast grown narrow with his woes:\nThe corn is turn'd to thistles & the apples into poison:\nThe birds of song to murderous crows, his joys to bitter groans!\nAnd self-exiled from the face of light & shine of morning,\nIn the dark world a narrow house! he wanders up and down,\nSeeking for rest and finding none! and hidden far within,\nHis Eon weeping in the cold and desolated Earth.\nAll his Affections now appear withoutside: all his Sons,\nHand, Hyle & Coban, Guantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd & Hutton,\nScofeld, Kox, Kotope & Bowen; his Twelve Sons: Satanic Mill!\nWho are the Spectres of the Twentyfour, each Double-form'd:\nRevolve upon his mountains groaning in pain: beneath\nThe dark incessant sky, seeking for rest and finding none:\nRaging against their Human natures, ravning to gormandize\nThe Human majesty and beauty of the Twentyfour.\nCondensing them into solid rocks with cruelty and abborrence\nSuspition & revenge, & the seven diseases of the Soul\nSettled around Albion and around Luvah in his secret cloud.\nWilling the Friends endur'd, for Albions sake, and for\nJerusalem his Emanation shut within his bosom;\nWhich hardend against them more and more; as he builded onwards\nOn the Gulph of Death in self-righteousness, that roll'd\nBefore his awful feet, in pride of virtue for victory:\nAnd Los was roofd in from Eternity in Albions Cliffs\nWhich stand upon the ends of Beulah, and withoutside, all\nAppear'd a rocky form against the Divine Humanity.\nAlbions Circumference was clos'd: his Center began darkning\nInto the Night of Beulah, and the Moon of Beulah rose\nClouded with storms: Los his strong Guard walkd round beneath the Moon\nAnd Albion fled inward among the currents of his rivers.\nHe found Jerusalem upon the River of his City soft repos'd\nIn the arms of Vala, assimilating in one with Vala\nThe Lilly of Havilah: and they sang soft thro' Lambeths vales,\nIn a sweet moony night & silence that they had created\nWith a blue sky spread over with wings and a mild moon,\nDividing & uniting into many female forms: Jerusalem\nTrembling! then in one comingling in eternal tears,\nSighing to melt his Giant beauty, on the moony river.\nPLATE 20\nBut when they saw Albion fall'n upon mild Lambeths vale:\nAstonish'd! Terrified! they hover'd over his Giant limbs.\nThen thus Jerusalem spoke, while Vala wove the veil of tears:\nWeeping in pleadings of Love, in the web of despair.\nWherefore hast thou shut me into the winter of human life\nAnd clos'd up the sweet regions of youth and virgin innocence:\nWhere we live, forgetting error, not pondering on evil:\nAmong my lambs & brooks of water, among my warbling birds:\nWhere we delight in innocence before the face of the Lamb:\nGoing in and out before him in his love and sweet affection.\nVala replied weeping & trembling, hiding in her veil.\nWhen winter rends the hungry family and the snow falls:\nUpon the ways of men hiding the paths of man and beast,\nThen mourns the wanderer: then he repents his wanderings & eyes\nThe distant forest; then the slave groans in the dungeon of stone.\nThe captive in the mill of the stranger, sold for scanty hire.\nThey view their former life: they number moments over and over;\nStringing them on their remembrance as on a thread of sorrow.\nThou art my sister and my daughter! thy shame is mine also!\nAsk me not of my griefs! thou knowest all my griefs.\nJerusalem answer'd with soft tears over the valleys.\nO Vala what is Sin? that thou shudderest and weepest\nAt sight of thy once lov'd Jerusalem! What is Sin but a little\nError & fault that is soon forgiven; but mercy is not a Sin\nNor pity nor love nor kind forgiveness! O! if I have Sinned\nForgive & pity me! O! unfold thy Veil in mercy & love!\nSlay not my little ones, beloved Virgin daughter of Babylon\nSlay not my infant loves & graces, beautiful daughter of Moab\nI cannot put off the human form I strive but strive in vain\nWhen Albion rent thy beautiful net of gold and silver twine;\nThou hadst woven it with art, thou hadst caught me in the bands\nOf love; thou refusedst to let me go: Albion beheld thy beauty\nBeautiful thro' our Love's comeliness, beautiful thro' pity.\nThe Veil shone with thy brightness in the eyes of Albion,\nBecause it inclosd pity & love; because we lov'd one-another!\nAlbion lov'd thee! he rent thy Veil! he embrac'd thee! he lov'd thee!\nAstonish'd at his beauty & perfection, thou forgavest his furious love:\nI redounded from Albions bosom in my virgin loveliness.\nThe Lamb of God reciev'd me in his arms he smil'd upon us:\nHe made me his Bride & Wife: he gave thee to Albion.\nThen was a time of love: O why is it passed away!\nThen Albion broke silence and with groans reply'd\nPLATE 21\nO Vala! O Jerusalem! do you delight in my groans\nYou O lovely forms, you have prepared my death-cup:\nThe disease of Shame covers me from bead to feet: I have no hope\nEvery boil upon my body is a separate & deadly Sin.\nDoubt first assaild me, then Shame took possession of me\nShame divides Families. Shame hath divided Albion in sunder!\nFirst fled my Sons, & then my Daughters, then my Wild Animations\nMy Cattle next, last ev'n the Dog of my Gate. the Forests fled\nThe Corn-fields, & the breathing Gardens outside separated\nThe Sea; the Stars: the Sun: the Moon: drivn forth by my disease\nAll is Eternal Death unless you can weave a chaste\nBody over an unchaste Mind! Vala! O that thou wert pure!\nThat the deep wound of Sin might be clos'd up with the Needle,\nAnd with the Loom: to cover Gwendolen & Ragan with costly Robes\nOf Natural Virtue, for their Spiritual forms without a Veil\nWither in Luvahs Sepulcher. I thrust him from my presence\nJerusalem! dissembler Jerusalem! I look into thy bosom:\nI discover thy secret places: Cordella! I behold\nThee whom I thought pure as the heavens in innocence & fear:\nThy Tabernacle taken down, thy secret Cherubim disclosed\nArt thou broken? Ah me Sabrina, running by my side:\nIn childhood what wert thou? unutterable anguish! Conwenna\nThy cradled infancy is most piteous. O hide, O hide!\nTheir secret gardens were made paths to the traveller:\nI knew not of their secret loves with those I hated most,\nNor that their every thought was Sin & secret appetite\nHyle sees in fear, he howls in fury over them, Hand sees\nIn jealous fear: in stern accusation with cruel stripes\nHe drives them thro' the Streets of Babylon before my face:\nBecause they taught Luvah to rise into my clouded heavens\nBattersea and Chelsea mourn for Cambel & Gwendolen!\nHackney and Holloway sicken for Estrild & Ignoge!\nBecause the Peak, Malvern & Cheviot Reason in Cruelty\nPenmaenmawr & Dhinas-bran Demonstrate in Unbelief\nManchester & Liverpool are in tortures of Doubt & Despair\nMalden & Colchester Demonstrate: I hear my Childrens voices3\nI see their piteous faces gleam out upon the cruel winds\nFrom Lincoln & Norwich, from Edinburgh & Monmouth:\nI see them distant from my bosom scoured along the roads\nThen lost in clouds; I hear their tender voices! clouds divide\nI see them die beneath the whips of the Captains! they are taken\nIn solemn pomp into Chaldea across the bredths of Europe\nSix months they lie embalmd in Silent death: warshipped4\nCarried in Arks of Oak before the armies in the spring\nBursting their Arks they rise again to life: they play before\nThe Armies: I hear their loud cymbals & their deadly cries\nAre the Dead cruel? are those who are infolded in moral Law\nRevengeful? O that Death & Annihilation were the same!\nThen Vala answerd spreading her scarlet Veil over Albion\nPLATE 22\nAlbion thy fear has made me tremble; thy terrors have surrounded me\nThy Sons have naild me on the Gates piercing my hands & feet:\nTill Skofields Nimrod the mighty Huntsman Jehovah came,\nWith Cush his Son & took me down. He in a golden Ark,\nBears me before his Armies tho my shadow hovers here\nThe flesh of multitudes fed & nourishd me in my childhood\nMy morn & evening food were prepard in Battles of Men\nGreat is the cry of the Hounds of Nimrod along the Valley\nOf Vision, they scent the odor of War in the Valley of Vision.\nAll Love is lost! terror succeeds & Hatred instead of Love t\nAnd stern demands of Right & Duty instead of Liberty\nOnce thou wast to me the loveliest Son of heaven; but now\nWhere shall I hide from thy dread countenance & searching eyes\nI have looked into the secret Soul of him I loved\nAnd in the dark recesses found Sin & can never return.\nAlbion again utterd his voice beneath the silent Moon\nI brought Love into light of day to pride in chaste beauty\nI brought Love into light & fancied Innocence is no more\nThen spoke Jerusalem O Albion! my Father Albion\nWhy wilt thou number every little fibre of my Soul\nSpreading them out before the Sun like stalks of flax to dry?\nThe Infant Joy is beautiful, but its anatomy\nHorrible ghast & deadly! nought shalt thou find in it\nBut dark despair & everlasting brooding melancholy!\nThen Albion turnd his face toward Jerusalem & spoke\nHide thou Jerusalem in impalpable voidness, not to be\nTouchd by the hand nor seen with the eye: O Jerusalem\nWould thou wert not & that thy place might never be found\nBut come O Vala with knife & cup: drain my blood\nTo the last drop! then hide me in thy Scarlet Tabernacle\nFor I see Luvah whom I slew. I behold him in my Spectre\nAs I behold Jerusalem in thee O Vala dark and cold\nJerusalem then stretchd her hand toward the Moon & spoke\nWhy should Punishment Weave the Veil with Iron Wheels of War\nWhen Forgiveness might it Weave with Wings of Cherubim\nLoud groand Albion from mountain to mountain & replied\nPLATE 23\nJerusalem! Jerusalem! deluding shadow of Albion!\nDaughter of my phantasy! unlawful pleasure! Albions curse!\nI came here with intention to annihilate thee! But\nMy soul is melted away, inwoven within the Veil\nHast thou again knitted the Veil of Vala, which I for thee\nPitying rent in ancient times. I see it whole and more\nPerfect, and shining with beauty! But thou! O wretched Father! t\nJerusalem reply'd, like a voice heard from a sepulcher:\nFather! once piteous! Is Pity. a Sin? Embalm'd in Vala's bosom\nIn an Eternal Death for. Albions sake, our best beloved.\nThou art my Father & my Brother: Why hast thou hidden me,\nRemote from the divine Vision: my Lord and Saviour.\nTrembling stood Albion at her words in jealous dark despair:\nHe felt that Love and Pity are the same; a soft repose!\nInward complacency of Soul: a Self-annihilation!\nI have erred! I am ashamed! and will never return more:\nI have taught my children sacrifices of cruelty: what shall I answer?\nI will hide it from Eternals! I will give myself for my Children!\nWhich way soever I turn, I behold Humanity and Pity!\nHe recoil'd: he rush'd outwards; he bore the Veil whole away\nHis fires redound from his Dragon Altars in Errors returning.\nHe drew the Veil of Moral Virtue, woven for Cruel Laws,\nAnd cast it into the Atlantic Deep, to catch the Souls of the Dead.\nHe stood between the Palm tree & the Oak of weeping\nWhich stand upon the edge of Beulah; and there Albion sunk\nDown in sick pallid languor! These were his last words, relapsing!\nHoarse from his rocks, from caverns of Derbyshire & Wales\nAnd Scotland, utter'd from the Circumference into Eternity.\nBlasphemous Sons of Feminine delusion! God in the dreary Void\nDwells from Eternity, wide separated from the Human Soul\nBut thou deluding Image by whom imbu'd the Veil I rent\nLo here is Valas Veil whole, for a Law, a Terror & a Curse!\nAnd therefore God takes vengeance on me: from my clay-cold bosom\nMy children wander trembling victims of his Moral justice.\nHis snows fall on me and cover me, while in the Veil I fold\nMy dying limbs. Therefore O Manhood, if thou art aught\nBut a meer Phantasy, hear dying Albions Curse!\nMay God who dwells in this dark Ulro & voidness, vengeance take,\nAnd draw thee down into this Abyss of sorrow and torture,\nLike me thy Victim. O that Death & Annihilation were the same!\nPLATE 24\nWhat have I said? What have I done? O all-powerful Human Words!\nYou recoil back upon me in the blood of the Lamb slain in his Children.\nTwo bleeding Contraries equally true, are his Witnesses against me\nWe reared mighty Stones: we danced naked around them:\nThinking to bring Love into light of day, to Jerusalems shame:\nDisplaying our Giant limbs to all the winds of heaven! Sudden\nShame siezd us, we could not look on one-another for abhorrence: the Blue\nOf our immortal Veins & all their Hosts fled from our Limbs,\nAnd wanderd distant in a dismal Night clouded & dark:\nThe Sun fled from the Britons forehead: the Moon from his mighty loins:\nScandinavia fled with all his mountains filld with groans,\nO what is Life & what is Man. O what is Death? Wherefore\nAre you my Children, natives in the Grave to where I go\nOr are you born to feed the hungry ravenings of Destruction\nTo be the sport of Accident! to waste in Wrath & Love, a weary\nLife, in brooding cares & anxious labours, that prove but chaff.\nO Jerusalem Jerusalem I have forsaken thy Courts\nThy Pillars of ivory & gold: thy Curtains of silk & fine\nLinen: thy Pavements of precious stones: thy Walls of pearl\nAnd gold, thy Gates of Thanksgiving thy Windows of Praise:\nThy Clouds of Blessing; thy Cherubims of Tender-mercy\nStretching their Wings sublime over the Little-ones of Albion\nO Human Imagination O Divine Body I have Crucified\nI have turned my back upon thee into the Wastes of Moral Law:\nThere Babylon is builded in the Waste, founded in Human desolation.\nO Babylon thy Watchman stands over thee in the night\nThy severe judge all the day long proves thee O Babylon\nWith provings of destruction, with giving thee thy hearts desire.\nBut Albion is cast forth to the Potter his Children to the Builders\nTo build Babylon because they have forsaken Jerusalem\nThe Walls of Babylon are Souls of Men: her Gates the Groans\nOf Nations: her Towers are the Miseries of once happy Families.\nHer Streets are paved with Destruction, her Houses built with Death\nHer Palaces with Hell & the Grave; her Synagogues with Torments\nOf ever-hardening Despair squard & polishd with cruel skill\nYet thou wast lovely as the summer cloud upon my hills\nWhen Jerusalem was thy hearts desire in times of youth & love.\nThy Sons came to Jerusalem with gifts, she sent them away\nWith blessings on their hands & on their feet, blessings of gold,\nAnd pearl & diamond: thy Daughters sang in her Courts:\nThey came up to Jerusalem; they walked before Albion\nIn the Exchanges of London every Nation walkd\nAnd London walkd in every Nation mutual in love & harmony\nAlbion coverd the whole Earth, England encompassd the Nations,\nMutual each within others bosom in Visions of Regeneration;\nJerusalem coverd the Atlantic Mountains & the Erythrean,\nFrom bright Japan & China to Hesperia France & England.\nMount Zion lifted his head in every Nation under heaven:\nAnd the Mount of Olives was beheld over the whole Earth:\nThe footsteps of the Lamb of God were there: but now no more\nNo more shall I behold him, he is closd in Luvahs Sepulcher.\nYet why these smitings of Luvah, the gentlest mildest Zoa?\nIf God was Merciful this could not be: O Lamb of God\nThou art a delusion and Jerusalem is my Sin!

{"title": "Epistle To John Hamilton Reynolds", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Dear Reynolds, as last night I lay in bed,\nThere came before my eyes that wonted thread\nOf shapes, and shadows, and remembrances,\nThat every other minute vex and please:\nThings all disjointed come from north and south,--\nTwo witch's eyes above a cherub's mouth,\nVoltaire with casque and shield and habergeon,\nAnd Alexander with his nightcap on;\nOld Socrates a-tying his cravat,\nAnd Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat;\nAnd Junius Brutus, pretty well so-so,\nMaking the best of's way towards Soho.\nFew are there who escape these visitings--\nPerhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings,\nAnd through whose curtains peeps no hellish nose,\nNo wild-boar tushes, and no mermaid's toes;\nBut flowers bursting out with lusty pride,\nAnd young AEolian harps personified;\nSome Titian colours touch'd into real life,--\nThe sacrifice goes on; the pontiff knife\nGleams in the sun, the milk-white heifer lows,\nThe pipes go shrilly, the libation flows:\nA white sail shows above the green-head cliff,\nMoves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff;\nThe mariners join hymn with those on land.\nYou know the Enchanted Castle -- it doth stand\nUpon a rock on the border of a lake,\nNested in trees, which all do seem to shake\nFrom some old magic like Urganda's sword.\nO Phoebus! that I had thy sacred word\nTo show this Castle in fair dreaming wise\nUnto my friend, while sick and ill he lies!\nYou know it well enough, where it doth seem\nA mossy place, a Merlin's Hall, a dream;\nYou know the clear lake, and the little isles,\nThe mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills--\nAll which elsewhere are but half animate,\nHere do they look alive to love and hate,\nTo smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound\nAbove some giant, pulsing underground.\nPart of the building was a chosen See\nBuilt by a banish'd Santon of Chaldee;\nThe other part, two thousand years from him,\nWas built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim;\nThen there's a little wing, far from the sun,\nBuilt by a Lapland witch turn'd maudlin nun;\nAnd many other juts of aged stone\nFounded with many a mason-devil's groan.\nThe doors all look as if they op'd themselves,\nThe windows as if latch'd by fays and elves,\nAnd from them comes a silver flash of light\nAs from the westward of a summer's night;\nOr like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes\nGone mad through olden songs and poesies.\nSee what is coming from the distance dim!\nA golden galley all in silken trim!\nThree rows of oars are lightening, moment whiles,\nInto the verdurous bosoms of those isles;\nTowards the shade under the Castle wall\nIt comes in silence -- now 'tis hidden all.\nThe clarion sounds, and from a postern-gate\nAn echo of sweet music doth create\nA fear in the poor herdsman who doth bring\nHis beasts to trouble the enchanted spring,--\nHe tells of the sweet music and the spot\nTo all his friends, and they believe him not.\nO that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,\nWould all their colours from the sunset take:\nFrom something of material sublime,\nRather than shadow our own soul's day-time\nIn the dark void of night. For in the world\nWe jostle- but my flag is not unfurl'd\nOn the Admiral-staff -- and to philosophize\nI dare not yet! Oh, never will the prize,\nHigh reason, and the lore of good and ill,\nBe my award! Things cannot to the will\nBe settled, but they tease us out of thought;\nOr is it that Imagination brought\nBeyond its proper bound, yet still confin'd,\nLost in a sort of Purgatory blind,\nCannot refer to any standard law\nOf either earth or heaven? It is a flaw\nIn happiness to see beyond our bourn,--\nIt forces us in summer skies to mourn,\nIt spoils the singing of the Nightingale.\nDear Reynolds! I have a mysterious tale\nAnd cannot speak it. The first page I read\nUpon a lampit rock of green sea-weed\nAmong the breakers; 'twas a quiet eve,\nThe rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave\nAn untumultuous fringe of silver foam\nAlong the flat brown sand; I was at home\nAnd should have been most happy,-- but I saw\nToo far into the sea, where every maw\nThe greater on the less feeds evermore.--\nBut I saw too distinct into the core\nOf an eternal fierce destruction,\nAnd so from happiness I far was gone.\nStill am I sick of it, and though to-day\nI've gather'd young spring-leaves, and flowers gay\nOf periwinkle and wild strawberry,\nStill do I that most fierce destruction see,--\nThe Shark at savage prey, the Hawk at pounce,--\nThe gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce,\nRavening a worm -- Away, ye horrid moods!\nMoods of one's mind! You know I hate them well.\nYou know I'd sooner be a clapping Bell\nTo some Kamschatcan Missionary Church,\nThan with these horrid moods be left i' the lurch.\nDo you get health -- and Tom the same -- I'll dance,\nAnd from detested moods in new Romance\nTake refuge. Of bad lines a Centaine dose\n'This epistle with a few lines of introduction in prose was written at Teignmouth, and is dated the 25 of March 1818 in the Life, Letters &c. where it first appeared. Keats says to his friend --\n\"In hopes of cheering you through a minute or two, I was determined, will he nill he, to send you some lines, so you will excuse the unconnected subject and careless verse. You know, I am sure, Claude's 'Enchanted Castle,' and I wish you may be pleased with my remembrance of it.\"\nSome thirty years ago this picture emerged from Lord Overstone's collection at Wickham Park, Bromley, and was exhibited at the British Institution. It was a favourite in Keats's circle. Hunt, in Imagination and Fancy, says of the \"perilous seas in faery lands forlorn\" passage in the Ode to a Nightingale, \"This beats Claude's Enchanted Castle, and the story of King Beder in the Arabian Nights.\"'\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

{"title": "Epistle To My Brother George", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Full many a dreary hour have I past,\nMy brain bewildered, and my mind o'ercast\nWith heaviness; in seasons when I've thought\nNo spherey strains by me could e'er be caught\nFrom the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze\nOn the far depth where sheeted lightning plays;\nOr, on the wavy grass outstretched supinely,\nPry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely:\nThat I should never hear Apollo's song,\nThough feathery clouds were floating all along\nThe purple west, and, two bright streaks between,\nThe golden lyre itself were dimly seen:\nThat the still murmur of the honey bee\nWould never teach a rural song to me:\nThat the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting\nWould never make a lay of mine enchanting,\nOr warm my breast with ardour to unfold\nSome tale of love and arms in time of old.\nBut there are times, when those that love the bay,\nFly from all sorrowing far, far away;\nA sudden glow comes on them, nought they see\nIn water, earth, or air, but poesy.\nIt has been said, dear George, and true I hold it,\n(For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,)\nThat when a Poet is in such a trance,\nIn air her sees white coursers paw, and prance,\nBestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel,\nWho at each other tilt in playful quarrel,\nAnd what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,\nIs the swift opening of their wide portal,\nWhen the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,\nWhose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear.\nWhen these enchanted portals open wide,\nAnd through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,\nThe Poet's eye can reach those golden halls,\nAnd view the glory of their festivals:\nTheir ladies fair, that in the distance seem\nFit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;\nTheir rich brimmed goblets, that incessant run\nLike the bright spots that move about the sun;\nAnd, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar\nPours with the lustre of a falling star.\nYet further off, are dimly seen their bowers,\nOf which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;\nAnd 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows\n'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose.\nAll that's revealed from that far seat of blisses\nIs the clear fountains' interchanging kisses,\nAs gracefully descending, light and thin,\nLike silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,\nWhen he upswimmeth from the coral caves,\nAnd sports with half his tail above the waves.\nThese wonders strange he sees, and many more,\nWhose head is pregnant with poetic lore.\nShould he upon an evening ramble fare\nWith forehead to the soothing breezes bare,\nWould he nought see but the dark, silent blue\nWith all its diamonds trembling through and through?\nOr the coy moon, when in the waviness\nOf whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,\nAnd staidly paces higher up, and higher,\nLike a sweet nun in holy-day attire?\nAh, yes! much more would start into his sight\u2014\nThe revelries and mysteries of night:\nAnd should I ever see them, I will tell you\nSuch tales as needs must with amazement spell you.\nThese are the living pleasures of the bard:\nBut richer far posterity's reward.\nWhat does he murmur with his latest breath,\nWhile his proud eye looks though the film of death?\n\"What though I leave this dull and earthly mould,\nYet shall my spirit lofty converse hold\nWith after times.\u2014The patriot shall feel\nMy stern alarum, and unsheath his steel;\nOr, in the senate thunder out my numbers\nTo startle princes from their easy slumbers.\nThe sage will mingle with each moral theme\nMy happy thoughts sententious; he will teem\nWith lofty periods when my verses fire him,\nAnd then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him.\nLays have I left of such a dear delight\nThat maids will sing them on their bridal night.\nGay villagers, upon a morn of May,\nWhen they have tired their gentle limbs with play\nAnd formed a snowy circle on the grass,\nAnd placed in midst of all that lovely lass\nWho chosen is their queen,\u2014with her fine head\nCrowned with flowers purple, white, and red:\nFor there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,\nAre emblems true of hapless lovers dying:\nBetween her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,\nA bunch of violets full blown, and double,\nSerenely sleep:\u2014she from a casket takes\nA little book,\u2014and then a joy awakes\nAbout each youthful heart,\u2014with stifled cries,\nAnd rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes:\nFor she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;\nOne that I fostered in my youthful years:\nThe pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,\nMust ever and anon with silent creep,\nLured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest\nShall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,\nBe lulled with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!\nThy dales, and hills, are fading from my view:\nSwiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions,\nFar from the narrow bound of thy dominions.\nFull joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,\nThat my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,\nAnd warm thy sons!\" Ah, my dear friend and brother,\nCould I, at once, my mad ambition smother,\nFor tasting joys like these, sure I should be\nHappier, and dearer to society.\nAt times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain\nWhen some bright thought has darted through my brain:\nThrough all that day I've felt a greater pleasure\nThan if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure.\nAs to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,\nI feel delighted, still, that you should read them.\nOf late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment,\nStretched on the grass at my best loved employment\nOf scribbling lines for you. These things I thought\nWhile, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught.\nE'en now I'm pillowed on a bed of flowers\nThat crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers\nAbove the ocean-waves, The stalks, and blades,\nChequer my tablet with their quivering shades.\nOn one side is a field of drooping oats,\nThrough which the poppies show their scarlet coats;\nSo pert and useless, that they bring to mind\nThe scarlet coats that pester human-kind.\nAnd on the other side, outspread, is seen\nOcean's blue mantle streaked with purple, and green.\nNow 'tis I see a canvassed ship, and now\nMark the bright silver curling round her prow.\nI see the lark dowm-dropping to his nest,\nAnd the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;\nFor when no more he spreads his feathers free,\nHis breast is dancing on the restless sea.\nNow I direct my eyes into the west,\nWhich at this moment is in sunbeams drest:\nWhy westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu!\n'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you!\nWritten in August, 1816.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Epistle-To-My-Brother-George"}

O that my known voice\nCould reach your dastard ears, and fright you more!\nFly, cowards, fly! Glocester is at your backs!\nThrow your slack bridles o'er the flurried manes,\nPly well the rowel with faint trembling heels,\nScampering to death at last!\nFirst Knight. The enemy\nBears his flaunt standard close upon their rear.\nSecond Knight. Sure of a bloody prey, seeing the fens\nWill swamp them girth-deep.\nStephen. Over head and ears,\nNo matter! 'Tis a gallant enemy;\nHow like a comet he goes streaming on.\nBut we must plague him in the flank, hey, friends?\nEnter Earl BALDWIN and Soldiers, as defeated.\nStephen. De Redvers!\nWhat is the monstrous bugbear that can fright\nBaldwin?\nBaldwin. No scare-crow, but the fortunate star\nOf boisterous Chester, whose fell truncheon now\nPoints level to the goal of victory.\nThis way he comes, and if you would maintain\nYour person unaffronted by vile odds,\nTake horse, my Lord.\nStephen. And which way spur for life?\nNow I thank Heaven I am in the toils,\nThat soldiers may bear witness how my arm\nCan burst the meshes. Not the eagle more\nLoves to beat up against a tyrannous blast,\nThan I to meet the torrent of my foes.\nThis is a brag, be 't so, but if I fall,\nCarve it upon my 'scutcheon'd sepulchre.\nOn, fellow soldiers!

Will Stephen's death be marked there, my good\nLord,\nOr that we gave him lodging in yon towers?\nGlocester. Fain would I know the great usurper's fate.\nEnter two Captains severally.\nFirst Captain. My Lord!\nSecond Captain. Most noble Earl!\nFirst Captain. The King\nSecond Captain. The Empress greets\nGlocester. What of the King?\nFirst Captain. He sole and lone maintains\nA hopeless bustle mid our swarming arms,\nAnd with a nimble savageness attacks,\nEscapes, makes fiercer onset, then anew\nEludes death, giving death to most that dare\nTrespass within the circuit of his sword!\nHe must by this have fallen. Baldwin is taken;\nAnd for the Duke of Bretagne, like a stag\nHe flies, for the Welsh beagles to hunt down.\nGod save the Empress!\nGlocester. Now our dreaded Queen:\nWhat message from her Highness?\nSecond Captain. Royal Maud\nFrom the throng'd towers of Lincoln hath look'd down,\nLike Pallas from the walls of Ilion,\nAnd seen her enemies havock'd at her feet.\nShe greets most noble Glocester from her heart,\nIntreating him, his captains, and brave knights,\nTo grace a banquet. The high city gates\nAre envious which shall see your triumph pass;\nThe streets are full of music.\nEnter Second Knight.\nGlocester. Whence come you?\nSecond Knight. From Stephen, my good Prince, Stephen!\nStephen!\nGlocester. Why do you make such echoing of his name?\nSecond Knight. Because I think, my lord, he is no man,\nBut a fierce demon, Anointed safe from wounds,\nAnd misbaptized with a Christian name.\nGlocester. A mighty soldier! Does he still hold out?\nSecond Knight. He shames our victory. His valour still\nKeeps elbow-room amid our eager swords,\nAnd holds our bladed falchions all aloof\nHis gleaming battle-axe being slaughter-sick,\nSmote on the morion of a Flemish knight,\nBroke short in his hand; upon the which he flung\nThe heft away with such a vengeful force,\nIt paunch'd the Earl of Chester's horse, who then\nSpleen-hearted came in full career at him.\nGlocester. Did no one take him at a vantage then?\nSecond Knight. Three then with tiger leap upon him flew,\nWhom, with his sword swift-drawn and nimbly held,\nHe stung away again, and stood to breathe,\nSmiling. Anon upon him rush'd once more\nA throng of foes, and in this renew'd strife,\nMy sword met his and snapp'd off at the hilts.\nGlocester.

And what if I could seize\nOne from Bellona's gleaming armoury,\nOr choose the fairest of her sheaved spears!\nWhere are my enemies? Here, close at hand,\nHere come the testy brood. O for a sword!\nI'm faint a biting sword! A noble sword!\nA hedge-stake or a ponderous stone to hurl\nWith brawny vengeance, like the labourer Cain.\nCome on! Farewell my kingdom, and all hail\nThou superb, plum'd, and helmeted renown,\nAll hail I would not truck this brilliant day\nTo rule in Pylos with a Nestor's beard\nCome on!\nEnter DE KAIMS and Knights, &c.\nDe Kaims. Is 't madness, or a hunger after death,\nThat makes thee thus unarm'd throw taunts at us?\nYield, Stephen, or my sword's point dip in\n\"he gloomy current of a traitor's heart.\nStephen. Do it, De Kaims, I will not budge an inch.\nDe Kaims. Yes, of thy madness thou shalt take the meed.\nStephen. Darest thou?\nDe Kaims. How dare, against a man disarmed?\nStephen. What weapons has the lion but himself?\nCome not near me, De Kaims, for by the price\nOf all the glory I have won this day,\nBeing a king, I will not yield alive\nTo any but the second man of the realm,\nRobert of Glocester.\nDe Kaims. Thou shalt vail to me.\nStephen. Shall I, when I have sworn against it, sir?\nThou think'st it brave to take a breathing king,\nThat, on a court-day bow'd to haughty Maud,\nThe awed presence-chamber may be bold\nTo whisper, there's the man who took alive\nStephen me prisoner. Certes, De Kaims,\nThe ambition is a noble one.\nDe Kaims. 'Tis true,\nAnd, Stephen, I must compass it.\nStephen. No, no,\nDo not tempt me to throttle you on the gorge,\nOr with my gauntlet crush your hollow breast,\nJust when your knighthood is grown ripe and full\nFor lordship.\nA Soldier. Is an honest yeoman's spear\nOf no use at a need? Take that.\nStephen. Ah, dastard!\nDe Kaims. What, you are vulnerable! my prisoner I\nStephen. No, not yet. I disclaim it, and demand\nDeath as a sovereign right unto a king\nWho 'sdains to yield to any but his peer,\nIf not in title, yet in noble deeds,\nThe Earl of Glocester. Stab to the hilts, De Kaims,\nFor I will never by mean hands be led\nFrom this so famous field. Do ye hear! Be quick!\n[Trumpets. Enter the Earl of CHESTER and Knights.\nSCENE IV. A Presence Chamber. Queen MAUD in a Chair of State, the\nEarls of GLOCESTER and CHESTER, Lords, Attendants.\nMaud. Glocester, no more: I will behold that Boulogne:\nSet him before me. Not for the poor sake\nOf regal pomp and a vain-glorious hour,\nAs thou with wary speech, yet near enough,\nHast hinted.\nGlocester. Faithful counsel have I given ;\nIf wary, for your Highness' benefit.\nMaud. The Heavens forbid that I should not think so,\nFor by thy valour have I won this realm,\nWhich by thy wisdom I will ever keep.\nTo sage advisers let me ever bend\n\"A meek attentive ear, so that they treat\nOf the wide kingdom's rule and government,\nNot trenching on our actions personal.\nAdvis'd, not school'd, I would be; and henceforth\nSpoken to in clear, plain, and open terms,\nNot side-ways sermon'd at.\nGlocester. Then, in plain terms,\nOnce more for the fallen king\nMaud. Your pardon, Brother,\nI would no more of that; for, as I said,\n\u2018Tis not for worldly pomp I wish to see\nThe rebel, but as dooming judge to give\nA sentence something worthy of his guilt.\nGlocester. If 't must be so, I'll bring him to your presence.\n[Exit GLOCESTER,\nMaud. A meaner summoner might do as well\nMy Lord of Chester, is 't true what I hear\nOf Stephen of Boulogne, our prisoner,\nThat he, as a fit penance for his crimes,\nEats wholesome, sweet, and palatable food\nOff Glocester's golden dishes drinks pure wine,\nLodgest soft?\nChester. More than that, my gracious Queen,\nHas anger'd me. The noble Earl, methinks,\nFull soldier as he is, and without peer\nIn counsel, dreams too much among his books.\nIt may read well, but sure 'tis out of date\nTo play the Alexander with Darius.\nMaud. Truth! I think so. By Heavens it shall not last!\nChester. It would amaze your Highness now to mark\nHow Glocester overstrains his courtesy\nTo that crime-loving rebel, that Boulogne\nMaud. That ingrate!\nChester. For whose vast ingratitude\nTo our late sovereign lord, your noble sire,\nThe generous Earl condoles in his mishaps,\nAnd with a sort of lackeying friendliness,\nTalks off the mighty frowning from his brow,\nWoos him to hold a duet in a smile,\nOr, if it please him, play an hour at chess\nMaud. A perjured slave!\nChester. And for his perjury,\nGlocester has fit rewards nay, I believe,\nHe sets his bustling household's wits at work\nFor flatteries to ease this Stephen's hours,\nAnd make a heaven of his purgatory ;\nAdorning bondage with the pleasant gloss\nOf feasts and music, and all idle shows\nOf indoor pageantry; while syren whispers,\nPredestined for his ear, 'scape as half-check'd\nFrom lips the courtliest and the rubiest\nOf all the realm, admiring of his deeds.\nMaud. A frost upon his summer!\nChester. A queen's nod\nCan make his June December.

He thereat was stung,\nPerverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim\nHer wild and timid nature to his aim:\nBesides, for all his love, in self despite,\nAgainst his better self, he took delight\nLuxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.\nHis passion, cruel grown, took on a hue\nFierce and sanguineous as \u2019twas possible\nIn one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.\nFine was the mitigated fury, like\nApollo\u2019s presence when in act to strike\nThe serpent\u2014Ha, the serpent! certes, she\nWas none. She burnt, she lov\u2019d the tyranny,\nAnd, all subdued, consented to the hour\nWhen to the bridal he should lead his paramour.\nWhispering in midnight silence, said the youth,\n\u201cSure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,\n\u201cI have not ask\u2019d it, ever thinking thee\n\u201cNot mortal, but of heavenly progeny,\n\u201cAs still I do. Hast any mortal name,\n\u201cFit appellation for this dazzling frame?\n\u201cOr friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,\n\u201cTo share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?\u201d\n\u201cI have no friends,\u201d said Lamia, \u201cno, not one;\n\u201cMy presence in wide Corinth hardly known:\n\u201cMy parents\u2019 bones are in their dusty urns\n\u201cSepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,\n\u201cSeeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,\n\u201cAnd I neglect the holy rite for thee.\n\u201cEven as you list invite your many guests;\n\u201cBut if, as now it seems, your vision rests\n\u201cWith any pleasure on me, do not bid\n\u201cOld Apollonius\u2014from him keep me hid.\u201d\nLycius, perplex\u2019d at words so blind and blank,\nMade close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,\nFeigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade\nOf deep sleep in a moment was betray\u2019d.\nIt was the custom then to bring away\nThe bride from home at blushing shut of day,\nVeil\u2019d, in a chariot, heralded along\nBy strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,\nWith other pageants: but this fair unknown\nHad not a friend. So being left alone,\n(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)\nAnd knowing surely she could never win\nHis foolish heart from its mad pompousness,\nShe set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress\nThe misery in fit magnificence.\nShe did so, but \u2019tis doubtful how and whence\nCame, and who were her subtle servitors.\nAbout the halls, and to and from the doors,\nThere was a noise of wings, till in short space\nThe glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.\nA haunting music, sole perhaps and lone\nSupportress of the faery-roof, made moan\nThroughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.\nFresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade\nOf palm and plantain, met from either side,\nHigh in the midst, in honour of the bride:\nTwo palms and then two plantains, and so on,\nFrom either side their stems branch\u2019d one to one\nAll down the aisled place; and beneath all\nThere ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.\nSo canopied, lay an untasted feast\nTeeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,\nSilently paced about, and as she went,\nIn pale contented sort of discontent,\nMission\u2019d her viewless servants to enrich\nThe fretted splendour of each nook and niche.\nBetween the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,\nCame jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst\nForth creeping imagery of slighter trees,\nAnd with the larger wove in small intricacies.\nApproving all, she faded at self-will,\nAnd shut the chamber up, close, hush\u2019d and still,\nComplete and ready for the revels rude,\nWhen dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.\nThe day appear\u2019d, and all the gossip rout.\nO senseless Lycius! Madman! wherefore flout\nThe silent-blessing fate, warm cloister\u2019d hours,\nAnd show to common eyes these secret bowers?\nThe herd approach\u2019d; each guest, with busy brain,\nArriving at the portal, gaz\u2019d amain,\nAnd enter\u2019d marveling: for they knew the street,\nRemember\u2019d it from childhood all complete\nWithout a gap, yet ne\u2019er before had seen\nThat royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;\nSo in they hurried all, maz\u2019d, curious and keen:\nSave one, who look\u2019d thereon with eye severe,\nAnd with calm-planted steps walk\u2019d in austere;\n\u2019Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh\u2019d,\nAs though some knotty problem, that had daft\nHis patient thought, had now begun to thaw,\nAnd solve and melt:\u2014\u2019twas just as he foresaw.\nHe met within the murmurous vestibule\nHis young disciple. \u201c\u2019Tis no common rule,\n\u201cLycius,\u201d said he, \u201cfor uninvited guest\n\u201cTo force himself upon you, and infest\n\u201cWith an unbidden presence the bright throng\n\u201cOf younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,\n\u201cAnd you forgive me.\u201d Lycius blush\u2019d, and led\nThe old man through the inner doors broad-spread;\nWith reconciling words and courteous mien\nTurning into sweet milk the sophist\u2019s spleen.\nOf wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,\nFill\u2019d with pervading brilliance and perfume:\nBefore each lucid pannel fuming stood\nA censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,\nEach by a sacred tripod held aloft,\nWhose slender feet wide-swerv\u2019d upon the soft\nWool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke\nFrom fifty censers their light voyage took\nTo the high roof, still mimick\u2019d as they rose\nAlong the mirror\u2019d walls by twin-clouds odorous.\nTwelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,\nHigh as the level of a man\u2019s breast rear\u2019d\nOn libbard\u2019s paws, upheld the heavy gold\nOf Ceres\u2019 horn, and, in huge vessels, wine\nCame from the gloomy tun with merry shine.\nThus loaded with a feast the tables stood,\nEach shrining in the midst the image of a God.\nWhen in an antichamber every guest\nHad felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press\u2019d,\nBy minist\u2019ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,\nAnd fragrant oils with ceremony meet\nPour\u2019d on his hair, they all mov\u2019d to the feast\nIn white robes, and themselves in order placed\nAround the silken couches, wondering\nWhence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.\nSoft went the music the soft air along,\nWhile fluent Greek a vowel\u2019d undersong\nKept up among the guests discoursing low\nAt first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;\nBut when the happy vintage touch\u2019d their brains,\nLouder they talk, and louder come the strains\nOf powerful instruments:\u2014the gorgeous dyes,\nThe space, the splendour of the draperies,\nThe roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,\nBeautiful slaves, and Lamia\u2019s self, appear,\nNow, when the wine has done its rosy deed,\nAnd every soul from human trammels freed,\nNo more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,\nWill make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine.\nSoon was God Bacchus at meridian height;\nFlush\u2019d were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright:\nGarlands of every green, and every scent\nFrom vales deflower\u2019d, or forest-trees branch rent,\nIn baskets of bright osier\u2019d gold were brought\nHigh as the handles heap\u2019d, to suit the thought\nOf every guest; that each, as he did please,\nMight fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow\u2019d at his ease.\nWhat wreath for Lamia? What for Lycius?\nWhat for the sage, old Apollonius?\nUpon her aching forehead be there hung\nThe leaves of willow and of adder\u2019s tongue;\nAnd for the youth, quick, let us strip for him\nThe thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim\nInto forgetfulness; and, for the sage,\nLet spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage\nWar on his temples. Do not all charms fly\nAt the mere touch of cold philosophy?\nThere was an awful rainbow once in heaven:\nWe know her woof, her texture; she is given\nIn the dull catalogue of common things.\nPhilosophy will clip an Angel\u2019s wings,\nConquer all mysteries by rule and line,\nEmpty the haunted air, and gnomed mine\u2014\nUnweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made\nThe tender-person\u2019d Lamia melt into a shade.\nBy her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,\nScarce saw in all the room another face,\nTill, checking his love trance, a cup he took\nFull brimm\u2019d, and opposite sent forth a look\n\u2019Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance\nFrom his old teacher\u2019s wrinkled countenance,\nAnd pledge him. The bald-head philosopher\nHad fix\u2019d his eye, without a twinkle or stir\nFull on the alarmed beauty of the bride,\nBrow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.\nLycius then press\u2019d her hand, with devout touch,\nAs pale it lay upon the rosy couch:\n\u2019Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;\nThen sudden it grew hot, and all the pains\nOf an unnatural heat shot to his heart.\n\u201cLamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?\n\u201cKnow\u2019st thou that man?\u201d Poor Lamia answer\u2019d not.\nHe gaz\u2019d into her eyes, and not a jot\nOwn\u2019d they the lovelorn piteous appeal:\nMore, more he gaz\u2019d: his human senses reel:\nSome hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;\nThere was no recognition in those orbs.\n\u201cLamia!\u201d he cried\u2014and no soft-toned reply.\nThe many heard, and the loud revelry\nGrew hush; the stately music no more breathes;\nThe myrtle sicken\u2019d in a thousand wreaths.\nBy faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;\nA deadly silence step by step increased,\nUntil it seem\u2019d a horrid presence there,\nAnd not a man but felt the terror in his hair.\n\u201cLamia!\u201d he shriek\u2019d; and nothing but the shriek\nWith its sad echo did the silence break.\n\u201cBegone, foul dream!\u201d he cried, gazing again\nIn the bride\u2019s face, where now no azure vein\nWander\u2019d on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom\nMisted the cheek; no passion to illume\nThe deep-recessed vision:\u2014all was blight;\nLamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white.\n\u201cShut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!\n\u201cTurn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban\n\u201cOf all the Gods, whose dreadful images\n\u201cHere represent their shadowy presences,\n\u201cMay pierce them on the sudden with the thorn\n\u201cOf painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,\n\u201cIn trembling dotage to the feeblest fright\n\u201cOf conscience, for their long offended might,\n\u201cFor all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,\n\u201cUnlawful magic, and enticing lies.\n\u201cCorinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!\n\u201cMark how, possess\u2019d, his lashless eyelids stretch\n\u201cAround his demon eyes! Corinthians, see!\n\u201cMy sweet bride withers at their potency.\u201d\n\u201cFool!\u201d said the sophist, in an under-tone\nGruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan\nFrom Lycius answer\u2019d, as heart-struck and lost,\nHe sank supine beside the aching ghost.\n\u201cFool! Fool!\u201d repeated he, while his eyes still\nRelented not, nor mov\u2019d; \u201cfrom every ill\n\u201cOf life have I preserv\u2019d thee to this day,\n\u201cAnd shall I see thee made a serpent\u2019s prey?\nThen Lamia breath\u2019d death breath; the sophist\u2019s eye,\nLike a sharp spear, went through her utterly,\nKeen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well\nAs her weak hand could any meaning tell,\nMotion\u2019d him to be silent; vainly so,\nHe look\u2019d and look\u2019d again a level--No!\n\u201cA Serpent!\u201d echoed he; no sooner said,\nThan with a frightful scream she vanished:\nAnd Lycius\u2019 arms were empty of delight,\nAs were his limbs of life, from that same night.\nOn the high couch he lay!\u2014his friends came round--\nSupported him\u2014no pulse, or breath they found,\nAnd, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound.\n(line 50): Keats adopted here, in the manuscript, a pointing notice before: he placed the note of interrogation at the end of this line, a semi-colon at the end of line 51, and a full-stop at the end of line 54. The pointing of the text is from the first edition.\n(lines 124-6): Leigh Hunt notes - \"This is the very quintessence of the romantic.\"\n(line 140): Rejected reading, \"wainscoated\" for \"marbled plain.\"\n(line 239): In the Autobiography of Haydon, as edited by the late Mr. Tom Taylor, we read at page 354 of Volume 1 (edition of 1853) that Keats and Lamb, at one of the meetings at Haydon's house, agreed that Newton \"had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow, by reducing it to the prismatic colours.\"  This meeting was what Haydon calls \"the immortal dinner\" of the 28th of December 1817; so that the idea appears to have persisted in Keats's mind.\n\"Philostratus, in his fourth book 'de Vita Apollonii', hath a memorable instance in this kind, which I may not omit, of one Menippus Lycius, a young man twenty-five years of age, that going betwixt Cenchreas and Corinth, met such a phantasm in the habit of a fair gentlewoman, which taking him by the hand, carried him home to her house, in the suburbs of Corinth, and told him she was a Phoenician by birth, and if he would tarry with her, he should hear her sing and play, and drink such wine as never any drank, and no man should molest him; but she, being fair and lovely, would live and die with him, that was fair and lovely to behold.  The young man, a philosopher, otherwise staid and discreet, able to moderate his passions, though not this of love, tarried with her a while to his great content, and at last married her, to whose wedding, amongst other guests, came Apollonius; who, by some probable conjectures, found her out to be a serpent, a lamia; and that all her furniture was, like Tantalus' gold, descried by Homer, no substance but mere illusions. When she saw herself descried, she wept, and desired Apollonius to be silent, but he would not be moved, and thereupon she, plate, house, and all that was in it, vanished in an instant: many thousands took notice of this fact, for it was done in the midst of Greece.\" ~ Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy.'

Winter is come and gone,\nBut grief returns with the revolving year;\nThe airs and streams renew their joyous tone;\nThe ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;\nFresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Season's bier;\nThe amorous birds now pair in every brake,\nAnd build their mossy homes in field and brere;\nAnd the green lizard, and the golden snake,\nLike unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.\nXIX.\nThrough wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean\nA quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst\nAs it has ever done, with change and motion,\nFrom the great morning of the world when first\nGod dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,\nThe lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;\nAll baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;\nDiffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight\nThe beauty and the joy of their renewed might.\nXX.\nThe leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,\nExhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;\nLike incarnations of the stars, when splendour\nIs changed to fragrance, they illumine death\nAnd mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;\nNought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows\nBe as a sword consumed before the sheath\nBy sightless lightning? -the intense atom glows\nA moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.\nXXI.\nAlas! that all we loved of him should be,\nBut for our grief, as if it had not been,\nAnd grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!\nWhence are we, and why are we? of what scene\nThe actors or spectators?

Chatterton\nRose pale, -his solemn agony had not\nYet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought\nAnd as he fell and as he lived and loved\nSublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,\nArose; and Lucan, by his death approved:\nOblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.\nXLVI.\nAnd many more, whose names on Earth are dark,\nBut whose transmitted effluence cannot die\nSo long as fire outlives the parent spark,\nRose, robed in dazzling immortality.\n\"Thou art become as one of us,\" they cry,\n\"It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long\nSwung blind in unascended majesty,\nSilent alone amid an Heaven of Song.\nAssume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!\"\nXLVII.\nWho mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth,\nFond wretch! and know thyself and him aright.\nClasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth;\nAs from a centre, dart thy spirit's light\nBeyond all worlds, until its spacious might\nSatiate the void circumference: then shrink\nEven to a point within our day and night;\nAnd keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink\nWhen hope has kindled hope, and lured thee to the brink.\nXLVIII.\nOr go to Rome, which is the sepulchre,\nOh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought\nThat ages, empires, and religions there\nLie buried in the ravage they have wrought;\nFor such as he can lend, -they borrow not\nGlory from those who made the world their prey;\nAnd he is gathered to the kings of thought\nWho waged contention with their time's decay,\nAnd of the past are all that cannot pass away.\nXLIX.\nGo thou to Rome, -at once the Paradise,\nThe grave, the city, and the wilderness;\nAnd where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,\nAnd flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress\nThe bones of Desolation's nakedness\nPass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead\nThy footsteps to a slope of green access\nWhere, like an infant's smile, over the dead\nA light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;\nAnd grey walls moulder round, on which dull Time\nFeeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;\nAnd one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,\nPavilioning the dust of him who planned\nThis refuge for his memory, doth stand\nLike flame transformed to marble; and beneath,\nA field is spread, on which a newer band\nHave pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,\nWelcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.\nLI.\nHere pause: these graves are all too young as yet\nTo have outgrown the sorrow which consigned\nIts charge to each; and if the seal is set,\nHere, on one fountain of a mourning mind,\nBreak it not thou! too surely shalt thou find\nThine own well full, if thou returnest home,\nOf tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind\nSeek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.\nWhat Adonais is, why fear we to become?\nLII.\nThe One remains, the many change and pass;\nHeaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;\nLife, like a dome of many-coloured glass,\nStains the white radiance of Eternity,\nUntil Death tramples it to fragments. -Die,\nIf thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!\nFlowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak\nThe glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.\nLIII.\nWhy linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?\nThy hopes are gone before: from all things here\nThey have departed; thou shouldst now depart!\nA light is passed from the revolving year,\nAnd man, and woman; and what still is dear\nAttracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.\nThe soft sky smiles, -the low wind whispers near:\n'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither,\nNo more let Life divide what Death can join together.\nLIV.\nThat Light whose smile kindles the Universe,\nThat Beauty in which all things work and move,\nThat Benediction which the eclipsing Curse\nOf birth can quench not, that sustaining Love\nWhich through the web of being blindly wove\nBy man and beast and earth and air and sea,\nBurns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of\nThe fire for which all thirst, now beams on me,\nConsuming the last clouds of cold mortality.\nLV.\nThe breath whose might I have invoked in song\nDescends on me; my spirit's bark is driven\nFar from the shore, far from the trembling throng\nWhose sails were never to the tempest given;\nThe massy earth and sphered skies are riven!\nI am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;\nWhilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,\nThe soul of Adonais, like a star,\nBeacons from the abode where the Eternal are.\nAdonais was composed at Pisa during the early days of June, 1821, and printed, with the author's name, at Pisa, 'with the types of Didot,'by July 13, 1821. Part of the impression was sent to the brothers Ollier for sale in London. An exact reprint of this Pisa edition (a few typographical errors only being corrected) was issued in 1829 by Gee & Bridges, Cambridge, at the instance of Arthur Hallan and Richard Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton). The poem was included in Galignani's edition of Coleridge, Shelley and Keats, Paris, 1829, and by Mrs. Shelley in the Poetical Works of 1839.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Adonais:-An-elegy-on-the-Death-of-John-Keats"}

I have made my bed\nIn charnels and on coffins, where black death\nKeeps record of the trophies won from thee,\nHoping to still these obstinate questionings\nOf thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost,\nThy messenger, to render up the tale\nOf what we are. In lone and silent hours,\nWhen night makes a weird sound of its own stillness,\nLike an inspired and desperate alchemist\nStaking his very life on some dark hope,\nHave I mixed awful talk and asking looks\nWith my most innocent love, until strange tears,\nUniting with those breathless kisses, made\nSuch magic as compels the charm\u00e8d night\nTo render up thy charge; and, though ne'er yet\nThou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary,\nEnough from incommunicable dream,\nAnd twilight phantasms, and deep noonday thought,\nHas shone within me, that serenely now\nAnd moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre\nSuspended in the solitary dome\nOf some mysterious and deserted fane,\nI wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain\nMay modulate with murmurs of the air,\nAnd motions of the forests and the sea,\nAnd voice of living beings, and woven hymns\nOf night and day, and the deep heart of man.\nThere was a Poet whose untimely tomb\nNo human hands with pious reverence reared,\nBut the charmed eddies of autumnal winds\nBuilt o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid\nOf mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:\nA lovely youth,\u2014no mourning maiden decked\nWith weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,\nThe lone couch of his everlasting sleep:\nGentle, and brave, and generous,\u2014no lorn bard\nBreathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh:\nHe lived, he died, he sung in solitude.\nStrangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,\nAnd virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined\nAnd wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.\nThe fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,\nAnd Silence, too enamoured of that voice,\nLocks its mute music in her rugged cell.\nBy solemn vision and bright silver dream\nHis infancy was nurtured. Every sight\nAnd sound from the vast earth and ambient air\nSent to his heart its choicest impulses.\nThe fountains of divine philosophy\nFled not his thirsting lips, and all of great,\nOr good, or lovely, which the sacred past\nIn truth or fable consecrates, he felt\nAnd knew. When early youth had passed, he left\nHis cold fireside and alienated home\nTo seek strange truths in undiscovered lands.\nMany a wide waste and tangled wilderness\nHas lured his fearless steps; and he has bought\nWith his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men,\nHis rest and food. Nature's most secret steps\nHe like her shadow has pursued, where'er\nThe red volcano overcanopies\nIts fields of snow and pinnacles of ice\nWith burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes\nOn black bare pointed islets ever beat\nWith sluggish surge, or where the secret caves,\nRugged and dark, winding among the springs\nOf fire and poison, inaccessible\nTo avarice or pride, their starry domes\nOf diamond and of gold expand above\nNumberless and immeasurable halls,\nFrequent with crystal column, and clear shrines\nOf pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite.\nNor had that scene of ampler majesty\nThan gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven\nAnd the green earth, lost in his heart its claims\nTo love and wonder; he would linger long\nIn lonesome vales, making the wild his home,\nUntil the doves and squirrels would partake\nFrom his innocuous band his bloodless food,\nLured by the gentle meaning of his looks,\nAnd the wild antelope, that starts whene'er\nThe dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend\nHer timid steps, to gaze upon a form\nMore graceful than her own.\nHis wandering step,\nObedient to high thoughts, has visited\nThe awful ruins of the days of old:\nAthens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste\nWhere stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers\nOf Babylon, the eternal pyramids,\nMemphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange,\nSculptured on alabaster obelisk\nOr jasper tomb or mutilated sphinx,\nDark \u00c6thiopia in her desert hills\nConceals. Among the ruined temples there,\nStupendous columns, and wild images\nOf more than man, where marble daemons watch\nThe Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men\nHang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around,\nHe lingered, poring on memorials\nOf the world's youth: through the long burning day\nGazed on those speechless shapes; nor, when the moon\nFilled the mysterious halls with floating shades\nSuspended he that task, but ever gazed\nAnd gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind\nFlashed like strong inspiration, and he saw\nThe thrilling secrets of the birth of time.\nMeanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,\nHer daily portion, from her father's tent,\nAnd spread her matting for his couch, and stole\nFrom duties and repose to tend his steps,\nEnamoured, yet not daring for deep awe\nTo speak her love, and watched his nightly sleep,\nSleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips\nParted in slumber, whence the regular breath\nOf innocent dreams arose; then, when red morn\nMade paler the pale moon, to her cold home\nWildered, and wan, and panting, she returned.\nThe Poet, wandering on, through Arabie,\nAnd Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,\nAnd o'er the a\u00ebrial mountains which pour down\nIndus and Oxus from their icy caves,\nIn joy and exultation held his way;\nTill in the vale of Cashmire, far within\nIts loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine\nBeneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,\nBeside a sparkling rivulet he stretched\nHis languid limbs. A vision on his sleep\nThere came, a dream of hopes that never yet\nHad flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veil\u00e8d maid\nSate near him, talking in low solemn tones.\nHer voice was like the voice of his own soul\nHeard in the calm of thought; its music long,\nLike woven sounds of streams and breezes, held\nHis inmost sense suspended in its web\nOf many-colored woof and shifting hues.\nKnowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,\nAnd lofty hopes of divine liberty,\nThoughts the most dear to him, and poesy,\nHerself a poet. Soon the solemn mood\nOf her pure mind kindled through all her frame\nA permeating fire; wild numbers then\nShe raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs\nSubdued by its own pathos; her fair hands\nWere bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp\nStrange symphony, and in their branching veins\nThe eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.\nThe beating of her heart was heard to fill\nThe pauses of her music, and her breath\nTumultuously accorded with those fits\nOf intermitted song. Sudden she rose,\nAs if her heart impatiently endured\nIts bursting burden; at the sound he turned,\nAnd saw by the warm light of their own life\nHer glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil\nOf woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,\nHer dark locks floating in the breath of night,\nHer beamy bending eyes, her parted lips\nOutstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly.\nHis strong heart sunk and sickened with excess\nOf love. He reared his shuddering limbs, and quelled\nHis gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet\nHer panting bosom:\u2014she drew back awhile,\nThen, yielding to the irresistible joy,\nWith frantic gesture and short breathless cry\nFolded his frame in her dissolving arms.\nNow blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night\nInvolved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,\nLike a dark flood suspended in its course,\nRolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.\nRoused by the shock, he started from his trance\u2014\nThe cold white light of morning, the blue moon\nLow in the west, the clear and garish hills,\nThe distinct valley and the vacant woods,\nSpread round him where he stood. Whither have fled\nThe hues of heaven that canopied his bower\nOf yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep,\nThe mystery and the majesty of Earth,\nThe joy, the exultation? His wan eyes\nGaze on the empty scene as vacantly\nAs ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven.\nThe spirit of sweet human love has sent\nA vision to the sleep of him who spurned\nHer choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues\nBeyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade;\nHe overleaps the bounds. Alas! alas!\nWere limbs and breath and being intertwined\nThus treacherously? Lost, lost, forever lost\nIn the wide pathless desert of dim sleep,\nThat beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death\nConduct to thy mysterious paradise,\nO Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds\nAnd pendent mountains seen in the calm lake\nLead only to a black and watery depth,\nWhile death's blue vault with loathliest vapors hung,\nWhere every shade which the foul grave exhales\nHides its dead eye from the detested day,\nConducts, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms?\nThis doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart;\nThe insatiate hope which it awakened stung\nHis brain even like despair.\nWhile daylight held\nThe sky, the Poet kept mute conference\nWith his still soul. At night the passion came,\nLike the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,\nAnd shook him from his rest, and led him forth\nInto the darkness. As an eagle, grasped\nIn folds of the green serpent, feels her breast\nBurn with the poison, and precipitates\nThrough night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud,\nFrantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight\nO'er the wide a\u00ebry wilderness: thus driven\nBy the bright shadow of that lovely dream,\nBeneath the cold glare of the desolate night,\nThrough tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,\nStartling with careless step the moon-light snake,\nHe fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,\nShedding the mockery of its vital hues\nUpon his cheek of death. He wandered on\nTill vast Aornos seen from Petra's steep\nHung o'er the low horizon like a cloud;\nThrough Balk, and where the desolated tombs\nOf Parthian kings scatter to every wind\nTheir wasting dust, wildly he wandered on,\nDay after day, a weary waste of hours,\nBearing within his life the brooding care\nThat ever fed on its decaying flame.\nAnd now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair,\nSered by the autumn of strange suffering,\nSung dirges in the wind; his listless hand\nHung like dead bone within its withered skin;\nLife, and the lustre that consumed it, shone,\nAs in a furnace burning secretly,\nFrom his dark eyes alone. The cottagers,\nWho ministered with human charity\nHis human wants, beheld with wondering awe\nTheir fleeting visitant. The mountaineer,\nEncountering on some dizzy precipice\nThat spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of Wind,\nWith lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet\nDisturbing not the drifted snow, had paused\nIn its career; the infant would conceal\nHis troubled visage in his mother's robe\nIn terror at the glare of those wild eyes,\nTo remember their strange light in many a dream\nOf after times; but youthful maidens, taught\nBy nature, would interpret half the woe\nThat wasted him, would call him with false names\nBrother and friend, would press his pallid hand\nAt parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path\nOf his departure from their father's door.\nAt length upon the lone Chorasmian shore\nHe paused, a wide and melancholy waste\nOf putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged\nHis steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,\nBeside a sluggish stream among the reeds.\nIt rose as he approached, and, with strong wings\nScaling the upward sky, bent its bright course\nHigh over the immeasurable main.\nHis eyes pursued its flight:\u2014'Thou hast a home,\nBeautiful bird! thou voyagest to thine home,\nWhere thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck\nWith thine, and welcome thy return with eyes\nBright in the lustre of their own fond joy.\nAnd what am I that I should linger here,\nWith voice far sweeter than thy dying notes,\nSpirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned\nTo beauty, wasting these surpassing powers\nIn the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven\nThat echoes not my thoughts?' A gloomy smile\nOf desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips.\nFor sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly\nIts precious charge, and silent death exposed,\nFaithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure,\nWith doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms.\nStartled by his own thoughts, he looked around.\nThere was no fair fiend near him, not a sight\nOr sound of awe but in his own deep mind.\nA little shallop floating near the shore\nCaught the impatient wandering of his gaze.\nIt had been long abandoned, for its sides\nGaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints\nSwayed with the undulations of the tide.\nA restless impulse urged him to embark\nAnd meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste;\nFor well he knew that mighty Shadow loves\nThe slimy caverns of the populous deep.\nThe day was fair and sunny; sea and sky\nDrank its inspiring radiance, and the wind\nSwept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves.\nLeaped in the boat; he spread his cloak aloft\nOn the bare mast, and took his lonely seat,\nAnd felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea\nLike a torn cloud before the hurricane.\nAs one that in a silver vision floats\nObedient to the sweep of odorous winds\nUpon resplendent clouds, so rapidly\nAlong the dark and ruffled waters fled\nThe straining boat. A whirlwind swept it on,\nWith fierce gusts and precipitating force,\nThrough the white ridges of the chaf\u00e8d sea.\nThe waves arose. Higher and higher still\nTheir fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge\nLike serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp.\nCalm and rejoicing in the fearful war\nOf wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast\nDescending, and black flood on whirlpool driven\nWith dark obliterating course, he sate:\nAs if their genii were the ministers\nAppointed to conduct him to the light\nOf those belov\u00e8d eyes, the Poet sate,\nHolding the steady helm. Evening came on;\nThe beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues\nHigh 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray\nThat canopied his path o'er the waste deep;\nTwilight, ascending slowly from the east,\nEntwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks\nO'er the fair front and radiant eyes of Day;\nMore horribly the multitudinous streams\nOf ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war\nRushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock\nThe calm and spangled sky. The little boat\nStill fled before the storm; still fled, like foam\nDown the steep cataract of a wintry river;\nNow pausing on the edge of the riven wave;\nNow leaving far behind the bursting mass\nThat fell, convulsing ocean; safely fled\u2014\nAs if that frail and wasted human form\nHad been an elemental god.\nAt midnight\nThe moon arose; and lo! the ethereal cliffs\nOf Caucasus, whose icy summits shone\nAmong the stars like sunlight, and around\nWhose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves\nBursting and eddying irresistibly\nRage and resound forever.\u2014Who shall save?\u2014\nThe boat fled on,\u2014the boiling torrent drove,\u2014\nThe crags closed round with black and jagged arms,\nThe shattered mountain overhung the sea,\nAnd faster still, beyond all human speed,\nSuspended on the sweep of the smooth wave,\nThe little boat was driven. A cavern there\nYawned, and amid its slant and winding depths\nIngulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on\nWith unrelaxing speed.\u2014'Vision and Love!'\nThe Poet cried aloud, 'I have beheld\nThe path of thy departure. Sleep and death\nShall not divide us long.'\nThe boat pursued\nThe windings of the cavern. Daylight shone\nAt length upon that gloomy river's flow;\nNow, where the fiercest war among the waves\nIs calm, on the unfathomable stream\nThe boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven,\nExposed those black depths to the azure sky,\nEre yet the flood's enormous volume fell\nEven to the base of Caucasus, with sound\nThat shook the everlasting rocks, the mass\nFilled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm;\nStair above stair the eddying waters rose,\nCircling immeasurably fast, and laved\nWith alternating dash the gnarl\u00e8d roots\nOf mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms\nIn darkness over it. I' the midst was left,\nReflecting yet distorting every cloud,\nA pool of treacherous and tremendous calm.\nSeized by the sway of the ascending stream,\nWith dizzy swiftness, round and round and round,\nRidge after ridge the straining boat arose,\nTill on the verge of the extremest curve,\nWhere through an opening of the rocky bank\nThe waters overflow, and a smooth spot\nOf glassy quiet 'mid those battling tides\nIs left, the boat paused shuddering.\u2014Shall it sink\nDown the abyss? Shall the reverting stress\nOf that resistless gulf embosom it?\nNow shall it fall?\u2014A wandering stream of wind\nBreathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,\nAnd, lo! with gentle motion between banks\nOf mossy slope, and on a placid stream,\nBeneath a woven grove, it sails, and, hark!\nThe ghastly torrent mingles its far roar\nWith the breeze murmuring in the musical woods.\nWhere the embowering trees recede, and leave\nA little space of green expanse, the cove\nIs closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers\nForever gaze on their own drooping eyes,\nReflected in the crystal calm. The wave\nOf the boat's motion marred their pensive task,\nWhich naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind,\nOr falling spear-grass, or their own decay\nHad e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed\nTo deck with their bright hues his withered hair,\nBut on his heart its solitude returned,\nAnd he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid\nIn those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame,\nHad yet performed its ministry; it hung\nUpon his life, as lightning in a cloud\nGleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods\nOf night close over it.\nThe noonday sun\nNow shone upon the forest, one vast mass\nOf mingling shade, whose brown magnificence\nA narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves,\nScooped in the dark base of their a\u00ebry rocks,\nMocking its moans, respond and roar forever.\nThe meeting boughs and implicated leaves\nWove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as, led\nBy love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death,\nHe sought in Nature's dearest haunt some bank,\nHer cradle and his sepulchre. More dark\nAnd dark the shades accumulate. The oak,\nExpanding its immense and knotty arms,\nEmbraces the light beech. The pyramids\nOf the tall cedar overarching frame\nMost solemn domes within, and far below,\nLike clouds suspended in an emerald sky,\nThe ash and the acacia floating hang\nTremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed\nIn rainbow and in fire, the parasites,\nStarred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around\nThe gray trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,\nWith gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,\nFold their beams round the hearts of those that love,\nThese twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs,\nUniting their close union; the woven leaves\nMake network of the dark blue light of day\nAnd the night's noontide clearness, mutable\nAs shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns\nBeneath these canopies extend their swells,\nFragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms\nMinute yet beautiful. One darkest glen\nSends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine\nA soul-dissolving odor to invite\nTo some more lovely mystery. Through the dell\nSilence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep\nTheir noonday watch, and sail among the shades,\nLike vaporous shapes half-seen; beyond, a well,\nDark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave,\nImages all the woven boughs above,\nAnd each depending leaf, and every speck\nOf azure sky darting between their chasms;\nNor aught else in the liquid mirror laves\nIts portraiture, but some inconstant star,\nBetween one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,\nOr painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,\nOr gorgeous insect floating motionless,\nUnconscious of the day, ere yet his wings\nHave spread their glories to the gaze of noon.\nHither the Poet came. His eyes beheld\nTheir own wan light through the reflected lines\nOf his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth\nOf that still fountain; as the human heart,\nGazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,\nSees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard\nThe motion of the leaves\u2014the grass that sprung\nStartled and glanced and trembled even to feel\nAn unaccustomed presence\u2014and the sound\nOf the sweet brook that from the secret springs\nOf that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed\nTo stand beside him\u2014clothed in no bright robes\nOf shadowy silver or enshrining light,\nBorrowed from aught the visible world affords\nOf grace, or majesty, or mystery;\nBut undulating woods, and silent well,\nAnd leaping rivulet, and evening gloom\nNow deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,\nHeld commune with him, as if he and it\nWere all that was; only\u2014when his regard\nWas raised by intense pensiveness\u2014two eyes,\nTwo starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought,\nAnd seemed with their serene and azure smiles\nTo beckon him.\nObedient to the light\nThat shone within his soul, he went, pursuing\nThe windings of the dell. The rivulet,\nWanton and wild, through many a green ravine\nBeneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell\nAmong the moss with hollow harmony\nDark and profound. Now on the polished stones\nIt danced, like childhood laughing as it went;\nThen, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept,\nReflecting every herb and drooping bud\nThat overhung its quietness.\u2014'O stream!\nWhose source is inaccessibly profound,\nWhither do thy mysterious waters tend?\nThou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,\nThy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,\nThy searchless fountain and invisible course,\nHave each their type in me; and the wide sky\nAnd measureless ocean may declare as soon\nWhat oozy cavern or what wandering cloud\nContains thy waters, as the universe\nTell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched\nUpon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste\nI' the passing wind!'\nBeside the grassy shore\nOf the small stream he went; he did impress\nOn the green moss his tremulous step, that caught\nStrong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one\nRoused by some joyous madness from the couch\nOf fever, he did move; yet not like him\nForgetful of the grave, where, when the flame\nOf his frail exultation shall be spent,\nHe must descend. With rapid steps he went\nBeneath the shade of trees, beside the flow\nOf the wild babbling rivulet; and now\nThe forest's solemn canopies were changed\nFor the uniform and lightsome evening sky.\nGray rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed\nThe struggling brook; tall spires of windlestrae\nThrew their thin shadows down the rugged slope,\nAnd nought but gnarl\u00e8d roots of ancient pines\nBranchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots\nThe unwilling soil. A gradual change was here\nYet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,\nThe smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin\nAnd white, and where irradiate dewy eyes\nHad shone, gleam stony orbs:\u2014so from his steps\nBright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade\nOf the green groves, with all their odorous winds\nAnd musical motions. Calm he still pursued\nThe stream, that with a larger volume now\nRolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there\nFretted a path through its descending curves\nWith its wintry speed. On every side now rose\nRocks, which, in unimaginable forms,\nLifted their black and barren pinnacles\nIn the light of evening, and its precipice\nObscuring the ravine, disclosed above,\n'Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves,\nWhose windings gave ten thousand various tongues\nTo the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands\nIts stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,\nAnd seems with its accumulated crags\nTo overhang the world; for wide expand\nBeneath the wan stars and descending moon\nIslanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,\nDim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom\nOf leaden-colored even, and fiery hills\nMingling their flames with twilight, on the verge\nOf the remote horizon. The near scene,\nIn naked and severe simplicity,\nMade contrast with the universe. A pine,\nRock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy\nIts swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast\nYielding one only response at each pause\nIn most familiar cadence, with the howl,\nThe thunder and the hiss of homeless streams\nMingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river\nFoaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,\nFell into that immeasurable void,\nScattering its waters to the passing winds.\nYet the gray precipice and solemn pine\nAnd torrent were not all;\u2014one silent nook\nWas there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,\nUpheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,\nIt overlooked in its serenity\nThe dark earth and the bending vault of stars.\nIt was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile\nEven in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped\nThe fissured stones with its entwining arms,\nAnd did embower with leaves forever green\nAnd berries dark the smooth and even space\nOf its inviolated floor; and here\nThe children of the autumnal whirlwind bore\nIn wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay,\nRed, yellow, or ethereally pale,\nRivals the pride of summer. 'T is the haunt\nOf every gentle wind whose breath can teach\nThe wilds to love tranquillity. One step,\nOne human step alone, has ever broken\nThe stillness of its solitude; one voice\nAlone inspired its echoes;\u2014even that voice\nWhich hither came, floating among the winds,\nAnd led the loveliest among human forms\nTo make their wild haunts the depository\nOf all the grace and beauty that endued\nIts motions, render up its majesty,\nScatter its music on the unfeeling storm,\nAnd to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,\nNurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,\nCommit the colors of that varying cheek,\nThat snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes.\nThe dim and horn\u00e8d moon hung low, and poured\nA sea of lustre on the horizon's verge\nThat overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist\nFilled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank\nWan moonlight even to fulness; not a star\nShone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,\nDanger's grim playmates, on that precipice\nSlept, clasped in his embrace.\u2014O storm of death,\nWhose sightless speed divides this sullen night!\nAnd thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still\nGuiding its irresistible career\nIn thy devastating omnipotence,\nArt king of this frail world! from the red field\nOf slaughter, from the reeking hospital,\nThe patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed\nOf innocence, the scaffold and the throne,\nA mighty voice invokes thee! Ruin calls\nHis brother Death! A rare and regal prey\nHe hath prepared, prowling around the world;\nGlutted with which thou mayst repose, and men\nGo to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,\nNor ever more offer at thy dark shrine\nThe unheeded tribute of a broken heart.\nWhen on the threshold of the green recess\nThe wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death\nWas on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,\nDid he resign his high and holy soul\nTo images of the majestic past,\nThat paused within his passive being now,\nLike winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe\nThrough some dim latticed chamber. He did place\nHis pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk\nOf the old pine; upon an ivied stone\nReclined his languid head; his limbs did rest,\nDiffused and motionless, on the smooth brink\nOf that obscurest chasm;\u2014and thus he lay,\nSurrendering to their final impulses\nThe hovering powers of life. Hope and Despair,\nThe torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear\nMarred his repose; the influxes of sense\nAnd his own being, unalloyed by pain,\nYet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed\nThe stream of thought, till he lay breathing there\nAt peace, and faintly smiling. His last sight\nWas the great moon, which o'er the western line\nOf the wide world her mighty horn suspended,\nWith whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed\nTo mingle. Now upon the jagged hills\nIt rests; and still as the divided frame\nOf the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood,\nThat ever beat in mystic sympathy\nWith Nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still;\nAnd when two lessening points of light alone\nGleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp\nOf his faint respiration scarce did stir\nThe stagnate night:\u2014till the minutest ray\nWas quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart.\nIt paused\u2014it fluttered. But when heaven remained\nUtterly black, the murky shades involved\nAn image silent, cold, and motionless,\nAs their own voiceless earth and vacant air.\nEven as a vapor fed with golden beams\nThat ministered on sunlight, ere the west\nEclipses it, was now that wondrous frame\u2014\nNo sense, no motion, no divinity\u2014\nA fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings\nThe breath of heaven did wander\u2014a bright stream\nOnce fed with many-voic\u00e8d waves\u2014a dream\nOf youth, which night and time have quenched forever\u2014\nStill, dark, and dry, and unremembered now.\nOh, for Medea's wondrous alchemy,\nWhich wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam\nWith bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale\nFrom vernal blooms fresh fragrance! Oh, that God,\nProfuse of poisons, would concede the chalice\nWhich but one living man has drained, who now,\nVessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels\nNo proud exemption in the blighting curse\nHe bears, over the world wanders forever,\nLone as incarnate death! Oh, that the dream\nOf dark magician in his visioned cave,\nRaking the cinders of a crucible\nFor life and power, even when his feeble hand\nShakes in its last decay, were the true law\nOf this so lovely world! But thou art fled,\nLike some frail exhalation, which the dawn\nRobes in its golden beams,\u2014ah! thou hast fled!\nThe brave, the gentle and the beautiful,\nThe child of grace and genius. Heartless things\nAre done and said i' the world, and many worms\nAnd beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth\nFrom sea and mountain, city and wilderness,\nIn vesper low or joyous orison,\nLifts still its solemn voice:\u2014but thou art fled\u2014\nThou canst no longer know or love the shapes\nOf this phantasmal scene, who have to thee\nBeen purest ministers, who are, alas!\nNow thou art not! Upon those pallid lips\nSo sweet even in their silence, on those eyes\nThat image sleep in death, upon that form\nYet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear\nBe shed\u2014not even in thought. Nor, when those hues\nAre gone, and those divinest lineaments,\nWorn by the senseless wind, shall live alone\nIn the frail pauses of this simple strain,\nLet not high verse, mourning the memory\nOf that which is no more, or painting's woe\nOr sculpture, speak in feeble imagery\nTheir own cold powers. Art and eloquence,\nAnd all the shows o' the world, are frail and vain\nTo weep a loss that turns their lights to shade.\nIt is a woe \"too deep for tears,\" when all\nIs reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,\nWhose light adorned the world around it, leaves\nThose who remain behind, not sobs or groans,\nThe passionate tumult of a clinging hope;\nBut pale despair and cold tranquillity,\nNature's vast frame, the web of human things,\nBirth and the grave, that are not as they were.\nComposed at Bishopsgate Heath, near Windsor Park, 1815 (autumn).\nNote by Mrs. Shelley: 'Alastor is written in a very different tone from Queen Mab. In the latter, Shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youth -- all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy, censure, and hope, to which the present suffering, and what he considers the proper destiny, of his fellow-creatures, gave birth.  Alastor, on the contrary, contains an individual interest only.  A very few years, with their attendant events, had checked the ardour of Shelley's hopes, though he still thought them well grounded, and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve.\nThis is neither the time nor the place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life. It will be sufficient to say that, in all he did, he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience; while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life. Physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward; inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad, and to make, as in Queen Mab, the whole universe the object and subject of his song.  In the Spring of 1815 an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption; abscesses were formed on his lungs, and he suffered acute spasms. suddenly a complete change took place; and, though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility, every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished.  His nerves, which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree, were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health.\nAs soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the Continent, he went abroad. He visited some of the more magnificent scenes of Switzerland, and returned to England from Lucerne, by the Reuss and the Rhine. The river-navigation enchanted him.  In his favourite poem of Thalaba, his imagination had been excited by a description of such a voyage. In the summer of 1815, after a tour along the southern coast of Devonshire and a visit to Clifton, he rented a house on Bishopgate Heath, on the borders of Windsor Forest, where he enjoyed several months of comparative health and tranquil happiness.  The later summer months were warm and dry.  Accompanied by a few friends, he visited the source of the Thames, making a voyage in a wherry from Winsdor to Crickdale.  His beautiful stanzas in the churchyard of Lechlade were written on that occasion.  Alastor was composed on his return. He spent his days under the oak-shades of Windsor Great Park; and the magnificent woodland was a fitting study to inspire the various descriptions of forest-scenery we find in the poem.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Alastor:-or,-the-Spirit-of-Solitude"}

{"title": "Ballad of Reading Gaol - I", "author": "Oscar Wilde", "text": "Version I\nHe did not wear his scarlet coat,\nFor blood and wine are red,\nAnd blood and wine were on his hands\nWhen they found him with the dead,\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\nAnd murdered in her bed.\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\nIn a suit of shabby grey;\nA cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay;\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\nWith sails of silver by.\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\nWithin another ring,\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\nA great or little thing,\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n\"That fellows got to swing.\"\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\nSuddenly seemed to reel,\nAnd the sky above my head became\nLike a casque of scorching steel;\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\nMy pain I could not feel.\nI only knew what hunted thought\nQuickened his step, and why\nHe looked upon the garish day\nWith such a wistful eye;\nThe man had killed the thing he loved\nAnd so he had to die.\nYet each man kills the thing he loves\nBy each let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\nSome with the hands of Gold:\nThe kindest use a knife, because\nThe dead so soon grow cold.\nSome love too little, some too long,\nSome sell, and others buy;\nSome do the deed with many tears,\nAnd some without a sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nYet each man does not die.\nHe does not die a death of shame\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\nNor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\nInto an empty place\nHe does not sit with silent men\nWho watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\nAnd when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\nThe prison of its prey.\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\nDread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\nTo put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\nHe does not know that sickening thirst\nThat sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\nSlips through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\nHe does not bend his head to hear\nThe Burial Office read,\nNor, while the terror of his soul\nTells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\nInto the hideous shed.\nHe does not stare upon the air\nThrough a little roof of glass;\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\nFor his agony to pass;\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\nThe kiss of Caiaphas.\nII.\nSix weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\nIn a suit of shabby grey:\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\nIts raveled fleeces by.\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\nThose witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\nIn the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\nAnd drank the morning air.\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\nNor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\nSome healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\nAs though it had been wine!\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\nWho tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\nA great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\nThe man who had to swing.\nAnd strange it was to see him pass\nWith a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\nSo wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\nHad such a debt to pay.\nFor oak and elm have pleasant leaves\nThat in the spring-time shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\nWith its adder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\nBefore it bears its fruit!\nThe loftiest place is that seat of grace\nFor which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\nUpon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\nHis last look at the sky?\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\nIs delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\nTo dance upon the air!\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\nWe watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\nWould end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\nHis sightless soul may stray.\nAt last the dead man walked no more\nAmongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\nIn God's sweet world again.\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\nWe had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\nWe had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\nBut in the shameful day.\nA prison wall was round us both,\nTwo outcast men were we:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\nAnd God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\nHad caught us in its snare.\nIII\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\nBeneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a Warder walked,\nFor fear the man might die.\nOr else he sat with those who watched\nHis anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\nThe Governor was strong upon\nThe Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\nA scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called\nAnd left a little tract.\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\nNo hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\nThe hangman's hands were near.\nBut why he said so strange a thing\nNo Warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\nIs given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\nAnd make his face a mask.\nOr else he might be moved, and try\nTo comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\nWe trod the Fool's Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\nThe Devil's Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\nMake a merry masquerade.\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\nAnd clattered with the pails.\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\nWe turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\nAnd sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\nTerror was lying still.\nSo still it lay that every day\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\nThat waits for fool and knave,\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\nWe passed an open grave.\nWith yawning mouth the yellow hole\nGaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\nSome prisoner had to swing.\nRight in we went, with soul intent\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\nWent shuffling through the gloom\nAnd each man trembled as he crept\nInto his numbered tomb.\nThat night the empty corridors\nWere full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\nStole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watcher watched him as he slept,\nAnd could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\nWith a hangman close at hand?\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\nWho never yet have wept:\nSo we\u2014the fool, the fraud, the knave\u2014\nThat endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\nAnother's terror crept.\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\nTo feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\nThe Warders with their shoes of felt\nCrept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\nGrey figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\nWho never prayed before.\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\nMad mourners of a corpse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight were\nThe plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd bitter wine upon a sponge\nWas the savior of Remorse.\nThe cock crew, the red cock crew,\nBut never came the day:\nAnd crooked shape of Terror crouched,\nIn the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\nBefore us seemed to play.\nThey glided past, they glided fast,\nLike travelers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\nOf delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\nThey trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\nLike the wind upon the sand!\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\nAs their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and loud they sang,\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\"Oho!\" they cried, \"The world is wide,\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\nIs a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\nIn the secret House of Shame.\"\nNo things of air these antics were\nThat frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\nMost terrible to see.\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs:\nWith the mincing step of demirep\nSome sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\nThe morning wind began to moan,\nBut still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\nCrept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\nThe weeping prison-wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning-steel\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\nTo have such a seneschal?\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\nAt seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\nThe prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\nHad entered in to kill.\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\nAre all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\nTo do the secret deed.\nWe were as men who through a fen\nOf filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\nOr give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\nAnd will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\nIt has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\nThe monstrous parricide!\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\nThat makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\nFor the best man and the worst.\nWe had no other thing to do,\nSave to wait for the sign to come:\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick\nLike a madman on a drum!\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\nSmote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\nOf impotent despair,\nLike the sound that frightened marshes hear\nFrom a leper in his lair.\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\nIn the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\nHooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\nStrangled into a scream.\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\nNone knew so well as I:\nFor he who live more lives than one\nMore deaths than one must die.\nIV.\nThere is no chapel on the day\nOn which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\nOr his face is far to wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\nWhich none should look upon.\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\nAnd then they rang the bell,\nAnd the Warders with their jingling keys\nOpened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\nEach from his separate Hell.\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\nBut not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\nAnd that man's face was grey,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw sad men who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWe prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every careless cloud that passed\nIn happy freedom by.\nBut their were those amongst us all\nWho walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each go his due,\nThey should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\nFor he who sins a second time\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud,\nAnd makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\nWith crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd no man spoke a word.\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd through each hollow mind\nThe memory of dreadful things\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\nAn Horror stalked before each man,\nAnd terror crept behind.\nThe Warders strutted up and down,\nAnd kept their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\nThere was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\nThat the man should have his pall.\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\nSuch as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\nNaked for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\nAnd all the while the burning lime\nEats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bone by night,\nAnd the soft flesh by the day,\nIt eats the flesh and bones by turns,\nBut it eats the heart alway.\nFor three long years they will

God's kindly earth\nIs kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but blow more red,\nThe white rose whiter blow.\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\nOut of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\nChrist brings his will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\nMay bloom in prison air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\nAre what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\nA common man's despair.\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\nPetal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\nThat God's Son died for all.\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\nStill hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit man not walk by night\nThat is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may not weep that lies\nIn such unholy ground,\nHe is at peace\u2014this wretched man\u2014\nAt peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\nThey did not even toll\nA requiem that might have brought\nRest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\nAnd hid him in a hole.\nThey stripped him of his canvas clothes,\nAnd gave him to the flies;\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\nIn which their convict lies.\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\nBy his dishonored grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\nWhom Christ came down to save.\nYet all is well; he has but passed\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourner will be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn.\nI know not whether Laws be right,\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in goal\nIs that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\nA year whose days are long.\nBut this I know, that every Law\nThat men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took his brother's life,\nAnd the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\nWith a most evil fan.\nThis too I know\u2014and wise it were\nIf each could know the same\u2014\nThat every prison that men build\nIs built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\nHow men their brothers maim.\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\nAnd they do well to hide their Hell,\nFor in it things are done\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\nEver should look upon!\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds\nBloom well in prison-air:\nIt is only what is good in Man\nThat wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\nAnd the Warder is Despair\nFor they starve the little frightened child\nTill it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\nAnd gibe the old and grey,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\nAnd none a word may say.\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\nIs foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\nChokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\nIn Humanity's machine.\nThe brackish water that we drink\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\nIs full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\nWild-eyed and cries to Time.\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\nLike asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\nFor what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\nBecomes one's heart by night.\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\nEach in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\nAnd never a human voice comes near\nTo speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\nIs pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\nWith soul and body marred.\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\nDegraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\nAnd some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\nAnd break the heart of stone.\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\nIn prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\nIts treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\nAh!

{"title": "Ballad of Reading Gaol II", "author": "Oscar Wilde", "text": "Version II\nHe did not wear his scarlet coat,\nFor blood and wine are red,\nAnd blood and wine were on his hands\nWhen they found him with the dead,\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\nAnd murdered in her bed.\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\nIn a suit of shabby gray;\nA cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay;\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\nWith sails of silver by.\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\nWithin another ring,\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\nA great or little thing,\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n\"That fellow's got to swing.\"\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\nSuddenly seemed to reel,\nAnd the sky above my head became\nLike a casque of scorching steel;\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\nMy pain I could not feel.\nI only knew what haunted thought\nQuickened his step, and why\nHe looked upon the garish day\nWith such a wistful eye;\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\nYet each man kills the thing he loves,\nBy each let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\nSome with the hands of Gold:\nThe kindest use a knife, because\nThe dead so soon grow cold.\nSome love too little, some too long,\nSome sell, and others buy;\nSome do the deed with many tears,\nAnd some without a sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nYet each man does not die.\nHe does not die a death of shame\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\nNor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\nInto an empty space.\nHe does not sit with silent men\nWho watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\nAnd when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\nThe prison of its prey.\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\nDread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\nTo put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\nHe does not feel that sickening thirst\nThat sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\nComes through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\nHe does not bend his head to hear\nThe Burial Office read,\nNor, while the anguish of his soul\nTells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\nInto the hideous shed.\nHe does not stare upon the air\nThrough a little roof of glass:\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\nFor his agony to pass;\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\nThe kiss of Caiaphas.\nSix weeks the guardsman walked the yard,\nIn the suit of shabby gray:\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step was light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\nIts ravelled fleeces by.\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\nThose witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\nIn the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\nAnd drank the morning air.\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\nNor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\nSome healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\nAs though it had been wine!\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\nWho tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\nA great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\nThe man who had to swing.\nFor strange it was to see him pass\nWith a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\nSo wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\nHad such a debt to pay.\nThe oak and elm have pleasant leaves\nThat in the spring-time shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\nWith its alder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\nBefore it bears its fruit!\nThe loftiest place is the seat of grace\nFor which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\nUpon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\nHis last look at the sky?\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\nIs delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\nTo dance upon the air!\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\nWe watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\nWould end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\nHis sightless soul may stray.\nAt last the dead man walked no more\nAmongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\nFor weal or woe again.\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\nWe had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\nWe had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\nBut in the shameful day.\nA prison wall was round us both,\nTwo outcast men we were:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\nAnd God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\nHad caught us in its snare.\nIII\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\nBeneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a warder walked,\nFor fear the man might die.\nOr else he sat with those who watched\nHis anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\nThe Governor was strong upon\nThe Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\nA scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called,\nAnd left a little tract.\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\nNo hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\nThe hangman's day was near.\nBut why he said so strange a thing\nNo warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\nIs given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\nAnd make his face a mask.\nOr else he might be moved, and try\nTo comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\nWe trod the Fools' Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\nThe Devils' Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\nMake a merry masquerade.\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\nAnd clattered with the pails.\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\nWe turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\nAnd sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\nTerror was lying still.\nSo still it lay that every day\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\nThat waits for fool and knave,\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\nWe passed an open grave.\nWith yawning mouth the horrid hole\nGaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\nThe fellow had to swing.\nRight in we went, with soul intent\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\nWent shuffling through the gloom:\nAnd I trembled as I groped my way\nInto my numbered tomb.\nThat night the empty corridors\nWere full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\nStole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watchers watched him as he slept,\nAnd could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\nWith a hangman close at hand.\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\nWho never yet have wept:\nSo we- the fool, the fraud, the knave-\nThat endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\nAnother's terror crept.\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\nTo feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\nThe warders with their shoes of felt\nCrept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\nGray figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\nWho never prayed before.\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\nMad mourners of a corse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight shook\nLike the plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd as bitter wine upon a sponge\nWas the savour of Remorse.\nThe gray cock crew, the red cock crew,\nBut never came the day:\nAnd crooked shapes of Terror crouched,\nIn the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\nBefore us seemed to play.\nThey glided past, the glided fast,\nLike travellers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\nOf delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\nThey trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\nLike the wind upon the sand!\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\nAs their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and long they sang,\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\"Oho!\" they cried, \"the world is wide,\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\nIs a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\nIn the secret House of Shame.\"\nNo things of air these antics were,\nThat frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\nMost terrible to see.\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs;\nWith the mincing step of a demirep\nSome sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\nThe morning wind began to moan,\nBut still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\nCrept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\nThe weeping prison wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning steel\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\nTo have such a seneschal?\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars,\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\nAt seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\nThe prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\nHad entered in to kill.\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\nAre all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\nTo do the secret deed.\nWe were as men who through a fen\nOf filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\nOr to give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way\nAnd will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\nIt has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong\nThe monstrous parricide!\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\nThat makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\nFor the best man and the worst.\nWe had no other thing to do,\nSave to wait for the sign to come:\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick,\nLike a madman on a drum!\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\nSmote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\nOf impotent despair,\nLike the sound the frightened marshes hear\nFrom some leper in his lair.\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\nIn the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\nHooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\nStrangled into a scream.\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\nNone knew so well as I:\nFor he who lives more lives than one\nMore deaths that one must die.\nThere is no chapel on the day\nOn which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\nOr his face is far too wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\nWhich none should look upon.\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\nAnd then they rang the bell,\nAnd the warders with their jingling keys\nOpened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\nEach from his separate Hell.\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\nBut not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\nAnd that man's face was gray,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw sad men who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWe prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every happy cloud that passed\nIn such strange freedom by.\nBut there were those amongst us all\nWho walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\nThey should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived,\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\nFor he who sins a second time\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud\nAnd makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\nWith crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd no man spoke a word.\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd through each hollow mind\nThe Memory of dreadful things\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\nAnd Terror crept behind.\nThe warders strutted up and down,\nAnd watched their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at,\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\nThere was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\nThat the man should have his pall.\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\nSuch as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\nNaked, for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\nAnd all the while the burning lime\nEats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bones by night,\nAnd the soft flesh by day,\nIt eats the flesh and bone by turns,\nBut it eats the heart alway.\nFor three long years they will not sow\nOr root or seedling there:\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\nWill sterile be and bare,\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\nWith unreproachful stare.\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\nEach simple seed they sow.\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\nIs kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but glow more red,\nThe white rose whiter blow.\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\nOut of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\nChrist brings His will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\nMay bloom in prison air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\nAre what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\nA common man's despair.\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\nPetal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\nThat God's Son died for all.\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\nStill hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit may not walk by night\nThat is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may but weep that lies\nIn such unholy ground,\nHe is at peace- this wretched man-\nAt peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\nThey did not even toll\nA requiem that might have brought\nRest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\nAnd hid him in a hole.\nThe warders stripped him of his clothes,\nAnd gave him to the flies:\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\nIn which the convict lies.\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\nBy his dishonoured grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\nWhom Christ came down to save.\nYet all is well; he has but passed\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourners be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn.\nI know not whether Laws be right,\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\nIs that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\nA year whose days are long.\nBut this I know, that every Law\nThat men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took His brother's life,\nAnd the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\nWith a most evil fan.\nThis too I know- and wise it were\nIf each could know the same-\nThat every prison that men build\nIs built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\nHow men their brothers maim.\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\nAnd the do well to hide their Hell,\nFor in it things are done\nThat Son of things nor son of Man\nEver should look upon!\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds\nBloom well in prison-air:\nIt is only what is good in Man\nThat wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\nAnd the warder is Despair.\nFor they starve the little frightened child\nTill it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\nAnd gibe the old and gray,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\nAnd none a word may say.\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\nIs a foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\nChokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\nIn Humanity's machine.\nThe brackish water that we drink\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\nIs full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\nWild-eyed, and cries to Time.\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\nLike asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\nFor what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\nBecomes one's heart by night.\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\nEach in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\nAnd never a human voice comes near\nTo speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\nIs pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\nWith soul and body marred.\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\nDegraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\nAnd some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\nAnd break the heart of stone.\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\nIn prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\nIts treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\nAh! happy they whose hearts can break\nAnd peace of pardon win!\nHow else may man make straight his plan\nAnd cleanse his soul from Sin?\nHow else but through a broken heart\nMay Lord Christ enter in?\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes,\nWaits for the holy hands that took\nThe Thief to Paradise;\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\nThe Lord will not despise.\nThe man in red who reads the Law\nGave him three weeks of life,\nThree little weeks in which to heal\nHis soul of his soul's strife,\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\nThe hand that held the knife.\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\nThe hand that held the steel:\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\nAnd only tears can heal:\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\nBecame Christ's snow-white seal.\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\nThere is a pit of shame,\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\nEaten by teeth of flame,\nIn a burning winding-sheet he lies,\nAnd his grave has got no name.\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\nIn silence let him lie:\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\nOr heave the windy sigh:\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\nAnd all men kill the thing they love,\nBy all let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Ballad-of-Reading-Gaol-II"}

{"title": "Charmides", "author": "Oscar Wilde", "text": ". HE was a Grecian lad, who coming home\nWith pulpy figs and wine from Sicily\nStood at his galley's prow, and let the foam\nBlow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,\nAnd holding wave and wind in boy's despite\nPeered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night\nTill with the dawn he saw a burnished spear\nLike a thin thread of gold against the sky,\nAnd hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,\nAnd bade the pilot head her lustily\nAgainst the nor'west gale, and all day long\nHeld on his way, and marked the rowers' time with measured song,\nAnd when the faint Corinthian hills were red\nDropped anchor in a little sandy bay,\nAnd with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,\nAnd brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,\nAnd washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold\nBrought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,\nAnd a rich robe stained with the fishes' juice\nWhich of some swarthy trader he had bought\nUpon the sunny quay at Syracuse,\nAnd was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,\nAnd by the questioning merchants made his way\nUp through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day\nHad spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,\nClomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet\nCrept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd\nOf busy priests, and from some dark retreat\nWatched the young swains his frolic playmates bring\nThe firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling\nThe crackling salt upon the flame, or hang\nHis studded crook against the temple wall\nTo Her who keeps away the ravenous fang\nOf the base wolf from homestead and from stall;\nAnd then the clear-voiced maidens 'gan to sing,\nAnd to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,\nA beechen cup brimming with milky foam,\nA fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery\nOf hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb\nDripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee\nHad ceased from building, a black skin of oil\nMeet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked\nspoil\nStolen from Artemis that jealous maid\nTo please Athena, and the dappled hide\nOf a tall stag who in some mountain glade\nHad met the shaft; and then the herald cried,\nAnd from the pillared precinct one by one\nWent the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had\ndone.\nAnd the old priest put out the waning fires\nSave that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed\nFor ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres\nCame fainter on the wind, as down the road\nIn joyous dance these country folk did pass,\nAnd with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.\nLong time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,\nAnd heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,\nAnd the rose-petals falling from the wreath\nAs the night breezes wandered through the shrine,\nAnd seemed to be in some entranc\u00e8d swoon\nTill through the open roof above the full and brimming moon\nFlooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,\nWhen from his nook upleapt the venturous lad,\nAnd flinging wide the cedar-carven door\nBeheld an awful image saffron-clad\nAnd armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared\nFrom the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared\nLike a red rod of flame, stony and steeled\nThe Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,\nAnd writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,\nAnd gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold\nIn passion impotent, while with blind gaze\nThe blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.\nThe lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp\nFar out at sea off Sunium, or cast\nThe net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp\nOf horses smite the waves, and a wild blast\nDivide the folded curtains of the night,\nAnd knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.\nAnd guilty lovers in their venery\nForgat a little while their stolen sweets,\nDeeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;\nAnd the grim watchmen on their lofty seats\nRan to their shields in haste precipitate,\nOr strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.\nFor round the temple rolled the clang of arms,\nAnd the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,\nAnd the air quaked with dissonant alarums\nTill huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,\nAnd on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,\nAnd the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.\nReady for death with parted lips he stood,\nAnd well content at such a price to see\nThat calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,\nThe marvel of that pitiless chastity,\nAh! well content indeed, for never wight\nSince Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.\nReady for death he stood, but lo! the air\nGrew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,\nAnd off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,\nAnd from his limbs he threw the cloak away,\nFor whom would not such love make desperate,\nAnd nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate\nUndid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,\nAnd bared the breasts of polished ivory,\nTill from the waist the peplos falling down\nLeft visible the secret mystery\nWhich to no lover will Athena show,\nThe grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow.\nThose who have never known a lover's sin\nLet them not read my ditty, it will be\nTo their dull ears so musicless and thin\nThat they will have no joy of it, but ye\nTo whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,\nYe who have learned who Eros is,\u2014O listen yet a-while.\nA little space he let his greedy eyes\nRest on the burnished image, till mere sight\nHalf swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,\nAnd then his lips in hungering delight\nFed on her lips, and round the towered neck\nHe flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.\nNever I ween did lover hold such tryst,\nFor all night long he murmured honeyed word,\nAnd saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed\nHer pale and argent body undisturbed,\nAnd paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\nHis hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\nIt was as if Numidian javelins\nPierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\nAnd his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins\nIn exquisite pulsation, and the pain\nWas such sweet anguish that he never drew\nHis lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.\nThey who have never seen the daylight peer\nInto a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,\nAnd with dull eyes and wearied from some dear\nAnd worshipped body risen, they for certain\nWill never know of what I try to sing,\nHow long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.\nThe moon was girdled with a crystal rim,\nThe sign which shipmen say is ominous\nOf wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\nAnd the low lightening east was tremulous\nWith the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,\nEre from the silent sombre shrine this lover had withdrawn.\nDown the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\nClomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\nAnd heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,\nAnd leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\nLike a young fawn unto an olive wood\nWhich in a shady valley by the well-built city stood.\nAnd sought a little stream, which well he knew,\nFor oftentimes with boyish careless shout\nThe green and crested grebe he would pursue,\nOr snare in woven net the silver trout,\nAnd down amid the startled reeds he lay\nPanting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.\nOn the green bank he lay, and let one hand\nDip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,\nAnd soon the breath of morning came and fanned\nHis hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly\nThe tangled curls from off his forehead, while\nHe on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.\nAnd soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak\nWith his long crook undid the wattled cotes,\nAnd from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke\nCurled through the air across the ripening oats,\nAnd on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed\nAs through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.\nAnd when the light-foot mower went afield\nAcross the meadows laced with threaded dew,\nAnd the sheep bleated on the misty weald,\nAnd from its nest the waking corn-crake flew,\nSome woodmen saw him lying by the stream\nAnd marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,\nNor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,\n\"It is young Hylas, that false runaway\nWho with a Naiad now would make his bed\nForgetting Herakles,\" but others, \"Nay,\nIt is Narcissus, his own paramour,\nThose are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.\"\nAnd when they nearer came a third one cried,\n\"It is young Dionysos who has hid\nHis spear and fawnskin by the river side\nWeary of hunting with the Bassarid,\nAnd wise indeed were we away to fly\nThey live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.\"\nSo turned they back, and feared to look behind,\nAnd told the timid swain how they had seen\nAmid the reeds some woodland God reclined,\nAnd no man dared to cross the open green,\nAnd on that day no olive-tree was slain,\nNor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain.\nSave when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail\nWell slung upon his back, with leap and bound\nRaced on the other side, and stopped to hail\nHoping that he some comrade new had found,\nAnd gat no answer, and then half afraid\nPassed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade\nA little girl ran laughing from the farm\nNot thinking of love's secret mysteries,\nAnd when she saw the white and gleaming arm\nAnd all his manlihood, with longing eyes\nWhose passion mocked her sweet virginity\nWatched him a-while, and then stole back sadly and wearily.\nFar off he heard the city's hum and noise,\nAnd now and then the shriller laughter where\nThe passionate purity of brown-limbed boys\nWrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,\nAnd now and then a little tinkling bell\nAs the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.\nThrough the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,\nThe grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,\nIn sleek and oily coat the water-rat\nBreasting the little ripples manfully\nMade for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough\nHopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough.\nOn the faint wind floated the silky seeds,\nAs the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,\nThe ousel-cock splashed circles in the reeds\nAnd flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,\nWhich scarce had caught again its imagery\nEre from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragonfly.\nBut little care had he for any thing\nThough up and down the beech the squirrel played,\nAnd from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing\nTo her brown mate her sweetest serenade,\nAh! little care indeed, for he had seen\nThe breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.\nBut when the herdsman called his straggling goats\nWith whistling pipe across the rocky road,\nAnd the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes\nBoomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode\nOf coming storm, and the belated crane\nPassed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain\nFell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,\nAnd from the gloomy forest went his way\nPast sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,\nAnd came at last unto a little quay,\nAnd called his mates a-board, and took his seat\nOn the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping\nsheet,\nAnd steered across the bay, and when nine suns\nPassed down the long and laddered way of gold,\nAnd nine pale moons had breathed their orisons\nTo the chaste stars their confessors, or told\nTheir dearest secret to the downy moth\nThat will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth\nCame a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes\nAnd lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked\nAs though the lading of three argosies\nWere in the hold, and flapped its wings, and shrieked,\nAnd darkness straightway stole across the deep,\nSheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,\nAnd the moon hid behind a tawny mask\nOf drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge\nRose the red plume, the huge and horn\u00e8d casque,\nThe seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!\nAnd clad in bright and burnished panoply\nAthena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!\nTo the dull sailors' sight her loosened locks\nSeemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet\nOnly the spume that floats on hidden rocks,\nAnd marking how the rising waters beat\nAgainst the rolling ship, the pilot cried\nTo the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side.\nBut he, the over-bold adulterer,\nA dear profaner of great mysteries,\nAn ardent amorous idolater,\nWhen he beheld those grand relentless eyes\nLaughed loud for joy, and crying out \"I come\"\nLeapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.\nThen fell from the high heaven one bright star,\nOne dancer left the circling galaxy,\nAnd back to Athens on her clattering car\nIn all the pride of venged divinity\nPale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,\nAnd a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.\nAnd the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew\nWith mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,\nAnd the old pilot bade the trembling crew\nHoist the big sail, and told how he had seen\nClose to the stern a dim and giant form,\nAnd like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.\nAnd no man dared to speak of Charmides\nDeeming that he some evil thing had wrought,\nAnd when they reached the strait Symplegades\nThey beached their galley on the shore, and sought\nThe toll-gate of the city hastily,\nAnd in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.\nII.\nBut some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare\nThe boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,\nAnd mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair\nAnd smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand,\nSome brought sweet spices from far Araby,\nAnd others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.\nAnd when he neared his old Athenian home,\nA mighty billow rose up suddenly\nUpon whose oily back the clotted foam\nLay diapered in some strange fantasy,\nAnd clasping him unto its glassy breast,\nSwept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!\nNow where Colonos leans unto the sea\nThere lies a long and level stretch of lawn,\nThe rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee\nFor it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun\nIs not afraid, for never through the day\nComes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.\nBut often from the thorny labyrinth\nAnd tangled branches of the circling wood\nThe stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth\nHurling the polished disk, and draws his hood\nOver his guilty gaze, and creeps away,\nNor dares to wind his horn, or\u2014else at the first break of day\nThe Dyrads come and throw the leathern ball\nAlong the reedy shore, and circumvent\nSome goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal\nFor fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,\nAnd loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,\nLest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.\nOn this side and on that a rocky cave,\nHung with the yellow-bell'd laburnum, stands,\nSmooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave\nLeaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,\nAs though it feared to be too soon forgot\nBy the green rush, its playfellow,\u2014and yet, it is a spot\nSo small, that the inconstant butterfly\nCould steal the hoarded honey from each flower\nEre it was noon, and still not satisfy\nIts over-greedy love,\u2014within an hour\nA sailor boy, were he but rude enow\nTo land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,\nWould almost leave the little meadow bare,\nFor it knows nothing of great pageantry,\nOnly a few narcissi here and there\nStand separate in sweet austerity,\nDotting the unmown grass with silver stars,\nAnd here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimetars.\nHither the billow brought him, and was glad\nOf such dear servitude, and where the land\nWas virgin of all waters laid the lad\nUpon the golden margent of the strand,\nAnd like a lingering lover oft returned\nTo kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,\nEre the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,\nThat self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,\nEre grisly death with chill and nipping frost\nHad withered up those lilies white and red\nWhich, while the boy would through the forest range,\nAnswered each other in a sweet antiphonal counterchange.\nAnd when at dawn the woodnymphs, hand-in-hand,\nThreaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied\nThe boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,\nAnd feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,\nAnd like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade,\nEach startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.\nSave one white girl, who deemed it would not be\nSo dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms\nCrushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,\nAnd longed to listen to those subtle charms\nInsidious lovers weave when they would win\nSome fenc\u00e8d fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin\nTo yield her treasure unto one so fair,\nAnd lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,\nCalled him soft names, played with his tangled hair,\nAnd with hot lips made havoc of his mouth\nAfraid he might not wake, and then afraid\nLest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,\nReturned to fresh assault, and all day long\nSat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,\nAnd held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,\nThen frowned to see how froward was the boy\nWho would not with her maidenhood entwine,\nNor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine,\nNor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,\nBut said, \"He will awake, I know him well,\nHe will awake at evening when the sun\nHangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel,\nThis sleep is but a cruel treachery\nTo make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea\nDeeper than ever falls the fisher's line\nAlready a huge Triton blows his horn,\nAnd weaves a garland from the crystalline\nAnd drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn\nThe emerald pillars of our bridal bed,\nFor sphered in foaming silver, and with coral-crown\u00e8d head,\nWe two will sit upon a throne of pearl,\nAnd a blue wave will be our canopy,\nAnd at our feet the water-snakes will curl\nIn all their amethystine panoply\nOf diamonded mail, and we will mark\nThe mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,\nVermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold\nLike flakes of crimson light, and the great deep\nHis glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,\nAnd we will see the painted dolphins sleep\nCradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks\nWhere Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.\nAnd tremulous opal-hued anemones\nWill wave their purple fringes where we tread\nUpon the mirrored floor, and argosies\nOf fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread\nThe drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,\nAnd honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.\"\nBut when that baffled Lord of War the Sun\nWith gaudy pennon flying passed away\nInto his brazen House, and one by one\nThe little yellow stars began to stray\nAcross the field of heaven, ah! then indeed\nShe feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,\nAnd cried, \"Awake, already the pale moon\nWashes the trees with silver, and the wave\nCreeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,\nThe croaking frogs are out, and from the cave\nThe night-jar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,\nAnd the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky\ngrass.\nNay, though thou art a God, be not so coy,\nFor in yon stream there is a little reed\nThat often whispers how a lovely boy\nLay with her once upon a grassy mead,\nWho when his cruel pleasure he had done\nSpread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.\nBe not so coy, the laurel trembles still\nWith great Apollo's kisses, and the fir\nWhose clustering sisters fringe the sea-ward hill\nHath many a tale of that bold ravisher\nWhom men call Boreas, and I have seen\nThe mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.\nEven the jealous Naiads call me fair,\nAnd every morn a young and ruddy swain\nWooes me with apples and with locks of hair,\nAnd seeks to soothe my virginal disdain\nBy all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;\nBut yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove\nOf seven spotted eggs the cruel lad\nHad stolen from the lofty sycamore\nAt day-break, when her amorous comrade had\nFlown off in search of berried juniper\nWhich most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager\nOf the blue grapes, hath not persistency\nSo constant as this simple shepherd-boy\nFor my poor lips, his joyous purity\nAnd laughing sunny eyes might well decoy\nA Dryad from her oath to Artemis;\nFor very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss,\nHis argent forehead, like a rising moon\nOver the dusky hills of meeting brows,\nIs crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon\nLeads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse\nFor Cyther\u00e6a, the first silky down\nFringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and\nbrown:\nAnd he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds\nOf bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,\nAnd many an earthen bowl of yellow curds\nIs in his homestead for the thievish fly\nTo swim and drown in, the pink clover mead\nAnd yet I love him not, it was for thee\nI kept my love, I knew that thou would'st come\nTo rid me of this pallid chastity;\nThou fairest flower of the flowerless foam\nOf all the wide \u00c6gean, brightest star\nOf ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!\nI knew that thou would'st come, for when at first\nThe dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of Spring\nSwelled in my green and tender bark or burst\nTo myriad multitudinous blossoming\nWhich mocked the midnight with its mimic moons\nThat did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous tunes\nStartled the squirrel from its granary,\nAnd cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,\nThrough my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy\nCrept like new wine, and every mossy vein\nThrobbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,\nAnd the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.\nThe trooping fawns at evening came and laid\nTheir cool black noses on my lowest boughs\nAnd on my topmost branch the blackbird made\nA little nest of grasses for his spouse,\nAnd now and then a twittering wren would light\nOn a thin twig which hardly bare the weigh of such delight.\nI was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,\nBeneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,\nAnd round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase\nThe timorous girl, till tired out with play\nShe felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,\nAnd turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare.\nThen come away unto my ambuscade\nWhere clustering woodbine weaves a canopy\nFor amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade\nOf Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify\nThe dearest rites of love, there in the cool\nAnd green recesses of its farthest depth there is a pool,\nThe ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,\nFor round its rim great creamy lilies float\nThrough their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,\nEach cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat\nSteered by a dragon-fly,\u2014be not afraid\nTo leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place were made\nFor lovers such as we, the Cyprian Queen,\nOne arm around her boyish paramour,\nStrays often there at eve, and I have seen\nThe moon strip off her misty vestiture\nFor young Endymion's eyes, be not afraid,\nThe panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.\nNay if thou wil'st, back to the beating brine,\nBack to the boisterous billow let us go,\nAnd walk all day beneath the hyaline\nHuge vault of Neptune's watery portico,\nAnd watch the purple monsters of the deep\nSport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.\nFor if my mistress find me lying here\nShe will not ruth or gentle pity show,\nBut lay her boar-spear down, and with austere\nRelentless fingers string the cornel bow,\nAnd draw the feathered notch against her breast,\nAnd loose the arch\u00e8d cord, ay, even now upon the quest\nI hear her hurrying feet,\u2014awake, awake,\nThou laggard in love's battle! once at least\nLet me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake\nMy parch\u00e8d being with the nectarous feast\nWhich even Gods affect! O come Love come,\nStill we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.\"\nScarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees\nShook, and the leaves divided, and the air\nGrew conscious of a God, and the grey seas\nCrawled backward, and a long and dismal blare\nBlew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,\nAnd like a flame a barb\u00e8d reed flew whizzing down the glade.\nAnd where the little flowers of her breast\nJust brake into their milky blossoming,\nThis murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,\nPierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,\nAnd ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,\nAnd dug a long red road, and cleft with wing\u00e8d death her heart.\nSobbing her life out with a bitter cry\nOn the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,\nSobbing for incomplete virginity,\nAnd raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,\nAnd all the pain of things unsatisfied,\nAnd the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing\nside.\nAh! pitiful it was to hear her moan,\nAnd very pitiful to see her die\nEre she had yielded up her sweets, or known\nThe joy of passion, that dread mystery\nWhich not to know is not to live at all,\nAnd yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.\nBut as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,\nWho with Adonis all night long had lain\nWithin some shepherd's hut in Arcady,\nOn team of silver doves and gilded wane\nWas journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar\nFrom mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,\nAnd when low down she spied the hapless pair,\nAnd heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,\nWhose cadence seemed to play upon the air\nAs though it were a viol, hastily\nShe bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,\nAnd dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous\ndoom.\nFor as a gardener turning back his head\nTo catch the last notes of the linnet, mows\nWith careless scythe too near some flower bed,\nAnd cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,\nAnd with the flower's loosened loveliness\nStrews the brown mould, or as some shepherd lad in wantonness\nDriving his little flock along the mead\nTreads down two daffodils which side by side\nHave lured the lady-bird with yellow brede\nAnd made the gaudy moth forget its pride,\nTreads down their brimming golden chalices\nUnder light feet which were not made for such rude ravages,\nOr as a schoolboy tired of his book\nFlings himself down upon the reedy grass\nAnd plucks two water-lilies from the brook,\nAnd for a time forgets the hour glass,\nThen wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,\nAnd lets the hot sun kill them, even so these lovers lay.\nAnd Venus cried, \"It is dread Artemis\nWhose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,\nOr else that mightier may whose care it is\nTo guard her strong and stainless majesty\nUpon the hill Athenian,\u2014alas!\nThat they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should pass.\nSo with soft hands she laid the boy and girl\nIn the great golden waggon tenderly,\nHer white throat whiter than a moony pearl\nJust threaded with a blue vein's tapestry\nHad not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast\nSwayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest.\nAnd then each pigeon spread its milky van,\nThe bright car soared into the dawning sky,\nAnd like a cloud the aerial caravan\nPassed over the \u00c6gean silently,\nTill the faint air was troubled with the song\nFrom the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.\nBut when the doves had reached their wonted goal\nWhere the wide stair of orb\u00e8d marble dips\nIts snows into the sea, her fluttering soul\nJust shook the trembling petals of her lips\nAnd passed into the void, and Venus knew\nThat one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,\nAnd bade her servants carve a cedar chest\nWith all the wonder of this history,\nWithin whose scented womb their limbs should rest\nWhere olive-trees make tender the blue sky\nOn the low hills of Paphos, and the faun\nPipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.\nNor failed they to obey her hest, and ere\nThe morning bee had stung the daffodil\nWith tiny fretful spear, or from its lair\nThe waking stag had leapt across the rill\nAnd roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept\nAthwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.\nAnd when day brake, within that silver shrine\nFed by the flames of cressets tremulous,\nQueen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine\nThat she whose beauty made Death amorous\nShould beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,\nAnd let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.\nIII.\nIn melancholy moonless Acheron,\nFar from the goodly earth and joyous day,\nWhere no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun\nWeighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May\nChequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,\nWhere thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,\nThere by a dim and dark Leth\u00e6an well\nYoung Charmides was lying, wearily\nHe plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,\nAnd with its little rifled treasury\nStrewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,\nAnd watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a\ndream,\nWhen as he gazed into the watery glass\nAnd through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned\nHis own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass\nAcross the mirror, and a little hand\nStole into his, and warm lips timidly\nBrushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh.\nThen turned he round his weary eyes and saw,\nAnd ever nigher still their faces came,\nAnd nigher ever did their young mouths draw\nUntil they seemed one perfect rose of flame,\nAnd longing arms around her neck he cast,\nAnd felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,\nAnd all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,\nAnd all her maidenhood was his to slay,\nAnd limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss\nTheir passion waxed and waned,\u2014O why essay\nTo pipe again of love too venturous reed!\nEnough, enough that Er\u00f4s laughed upon that flowerless mead.\nToo venturous poesy O why essay\nTo pipe again of passion! fold thy wings\nO'er daring Icarus and bid thy lay\nSleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings,\nTill thou hast found the old Castalian rill,\nOr from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quill!\nEnough, enough that he whose life had been\nA fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,\nCould in the loveless land of Hades glean\nOne scorching harvest from those fields of flame\nWhere passion walks with naked unshod feet\nAnd is not wounded,\u2014ah! enough that once their lips could meet\nIn that wild throb when all existences\nSeem narrowed to one single ecstasy\nWhich dies through its own sweetness and the stress\nOf too much pleasure, ere Persephone\nHad bade them serve her by the ebon throne\nOf the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis",

{"title": "Lamia. Part I", "author": "John Keats", "text": "Upon a time, before the faery broods\nDrove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,\nBefore King Oberon's bright diadem,\nSceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,\nFrighted away the Dryads and the Fauns\nFrom rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,\nThe ever-smitten Hermes empty left\nHis golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft:\nFrom high Olympus had he stolen light,\nOn this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight\nOf his great summoner, and made retreat\nInto a forest on the shores of Crete.\nFor somewhere in that sacred island dwelt\nA nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;\nAt whose white feet the languid Tritons poured\nPearls, while on land they wither\u2019d and adored.\nFast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,\nAnd in those meads where sometime she might haunt,\nWere strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,\nThough Fancy\u2019s casket were unlock\u2019d to choose.\nAh, what a world of love was at her feet!\nSo Hermes thought, and a celestial heat\nBurnt from his winged heels to either ear,\nThat from a whiteness, as the lily clear,\nBlush\u2019d into roses \u2019mid his golden hair,\nFallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.\nFrom vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,\nBreathing upon the flowers his passion new,\nAnd wound with many a river to its head,\nTo find where this sweet nymph prepar\u2019d her secret bed:\nIn vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,\nAnd so he rested, on the lonely ground,\nPensive, and full of painful jealousies\nOf the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.\nThere as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,\nSuch as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys\nAll pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake:\n\u201cWhen from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!\n\u201cWhen move in a sweet body fit for life,\n\u201cAnd love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife\n\u201cOf hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!\u201d\nThe God, dove-footed, glided silently\nRound bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,\nThe taller grasses and full-flowering weed,\nUntil he found a palpitating snake,\nBright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.\nShe was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,\nVermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;\nStriped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,\nEyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr\u2019d;\nAnd full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,\nDissolv\u2019d, or brighter shone, or interwreathed\nTheir lustres with the gloomier tapestries\u2014\nSo rainbow-sided, touch\u2019d with miseries,\nShe seem\u2019d, at once, some penanced lady elf,\nSome demon\u2019s mistress, or the demon\u2019s self.\nUpon her crest she wore a wannish fire\nSprinkled with stars, like Ariadne\u2019s tiar:\nHer head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!\nShe had a woman\u2019s mouth with all its pearls complete:\nAnd for her eyes: what could such eyes do there\nBut weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?\nAs Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.\nHer throat was serpent, but the words she spake\nCame, as through bubbling honey, for Love\u2019s sake,\nAnd thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,\nLike a stoop\u2019d falcon ere he takes his prey.\n\u201cFair Hermes, crown\u2019d with feathers, fluttering light,\n\u201cI had a splendid dream of thee last night:\n\u201cI saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,\n\u201cAmong the Gods, upon Olympus old,\n\u201cThe only sad one; for thou didst not hear\n\u201cThe soft, lute-finger\u2019d Muses chaunting clear,\n\u201cNor even Apollo when he sang alone,\n\u201cDeaf to his throbbing throat\u2019s long, long melodious moan.\n\u201cI dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes,\n\u201cBreak amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,\n\u201cAnd, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart,\n\u201cStrike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!\n\u201cToo gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?\u201d\nWhereat the star of Lethe not delay\u2019d\nHis rosy eloquence, and thus inquired:\n\u201cThou smooth-lipp\u2019d serpent, surely high inspired!\n\u201cThou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,\n\u201cPossess whatever bliss thou canst devise,\n\u201cTelling me only where my nymph is fled,\u2014\n\u201cWhere she doth breathe!\u201d \u201cBright planet, thou hast said,\u201d\nReturn\u2019d the snake, \u201cbut seal with oaths, fair God!\u201d\n\u201cI swear,\u201d said Hermes, \u201cby my serpent rod,\n\u201cAnd by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!\u201d\nLight flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown.\nThen thus again the brilliance feminine:\n\u201cToo frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine,\n\u201cFree as the air, invisibly, she strays\n\u201cAbout these thornless wilds; her pleasant days\n\u201cShe tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet\n\u201cLeave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;\n\u201cFrom weary tendrils, and bow\u2019d branches green,\n\u201cShe plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen:\n\u201cAnd by my power is her beauty veil\u2019d\n\u201cTo keep it unaffronted, unassail\u2019d\n\u201cBy the love-glances of unlovely eyes,\n\u201cOf Satyrs, Fauns, and blear\u2019d Silenus\u2019 sighs.\n\u201cPale grew her immortality, for woe\n\u201cOf all these lovers, and she grieved so\n\u201cI took compassion on her, bade her steep\n\u201cHer hair in weird syrops, that would keep\n\u201cHer loveliness invisible, yet free\n\u201cTo wander as she loves, in liberty.\n\u201cThou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone,\n\u201cIf thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!\u201d\nThen, once again, the charmed God began\nAn oath, and through the serpent\u2019s ears it ran\nWarm, tremulous, devout, psalterian.\nRavish\u2019d, she lifted her Circean head,\nBlush\u2019d a live damask, and swift-lisping said,\n\u201cI was a woman, let me have once more\n\u201cA woman\u2019s shape, and charming as before.\n\u201cI love a youth of Corinth\u2014O the bliss!\n\u201cGive me my woman\u2019s form, and place me where he is.\n\u201cStoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,\n\u201cAnd thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now.\u201d\nThe God on half-shut feathers sank serene,\nShe breath\u2019d upon his eyes, and swift was seen\nOf both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.\nIt was no dream; or say a dream it was,\nReal are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass\nTheir pleasures in a long immortal dream.\nOne warm, flush\u2019d moment, hovering, it might seem\nDash\u2019d by the wood-nymph\u2019s beauty, so he burn\u2019d;\nThen, lighting on the printless verdure, turn\u2019d\nTo the swoon\u2019d serpent, and with languid arm,\nDelicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm.\nSo done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent,\nFull of adoring tears and blandishment,\nAnd towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane,\nFaded before him, cower\u2019d, nor could restrain\nHer fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower\nThat faints into itself at evening hour:\nBut the God fostering her chilled hand,\nShe felt the warmth, her eyelids open\u2019d bland,\nAnd, like new flowers at morning song of bees,\nBloom\u2019d, and gave up her honey to the lees.\nInto the green-recessed woods they flew;\nNor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.\nLeft to herself, the serpent now began\nTo change; her elfin blood in madness ran,\nHer mouth foam\u2019d, and the grass, therewith besprent,\nWither\u2019d at dew so sweet and virulent;\nHer eyes in torture fix\u2019d, and anguish drear,\nHot, glaz\u2019d, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,\nFlash\u2019d phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear.\nThe colours all inflam\u2019d throughout her train,\nShe writh\u2019d about, convuls\u2019d with scarlet pain:\nA deep volcanian yellow took the place\nOf all her milder-mooned body\u2019s grace;\nAnd, as the lava ravishes the mead,\nSpoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede;\nMade gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,\nEclips\u2019d her crescents, and lick\u2019d up her stars:\nSo that, in moments few, she was undrest\nOf all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,\nAnd rubious-argent: of all these bereft,\nNothing but pain and ugliness were left.\nStill shone her crown; that vanish\u2019d, also she\nMelted and disappear\u2019d as suddenly;\nAnd in the air, her new voice luting soft,\nCried, \u201cLycius! gentle Lycius!\u201d\u2014Borne aloft\nWith the bright mists about the mountains hoar\nThese words dissolv\u2019d: Crete\u2019s forests heard no more.\nWhither fled Lamia, now a lady bright,\nA full-born beauty new and exquisite?\nShe fled into that valley they pass o\u2019er\nWho go to Corinth from Cenchreas\u2019 shore;\nAnd rested at the foot of those wild hills,\nThe rugged founts of the Peraean rills,\nAnd of that other ridge whose barren back\nStretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,\nSouth-westward to Cleone. There she stood\nAbout a young bird\u2019s flutter from a wood,\nFair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,\nBy a clear pool, wherein she passioned\nTo see herself escap\u2019d from so sore ills,\nWhile her robes flaunted with the daffodils.\nAh, happy Lycius!\u2014for she was a maid\nMore beautiful than ever twisted braid,\nOr sigh\u2019d, or blush\u2019d, or on spring-flowered lea\nSpread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy:\nA virgin purest lipp\u2019d, yet in the lore\nOf love deep learned to the red heart\u2019s core:\nNot one hour old, yet of sciential brain\nTo unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;\nDefine their pettish limits, and estrange\nTheir points of contact, and swift counterchange;\nIntrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart\nIts most ambiguous atoms with sure art;\nAs though in Cupid\u2019s college she had spent\nSweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,\nAnd kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.\nWhy this fair creature chose so fairily\nBy the wayside to linger, we shall see;\nBut first \u2019tis fit to tell how she could muse\nAnd dream, when in the serpent prison-house,\nOf all she list, strange or magnificent:\nHow, ever, where she will\u2019d, her spirit went;\nWhether to faint Elysium, or where\nDown through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair\nWind into Thetis\u2019 bower by many a pearly stair;\nOr where God Bacchus drains his cups divine,\nStretch\u2019d out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;\nOr where in Pluto\u2019s gardens palatine\nMulciber\u2019s columns gleam in far piazzian line.\nAnd sometimes into cities she would send\nHer dream, with feast and rioting to blend;\nAnd once, while among mortals dreaming thus,\nShe saw the young Corinthian Lycius\nCharioting foremost in the envious race,\nLike a young Jove with calm uneager face,\nAnd fell into a swooning love of him.\nNow on the moth-time of that evening dim\nHe would return that way, as well she knew,\nTo Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew\nThe eastern soft wind, and his galley now\nGrated the quaystones with her brazen prow\nIn port Cenchreas, from Egina isle\nFresh anchor\u2019d; whither he had been awhile\nTo sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there\nWaits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.\nJove heard his vows, and better\u2019d his desire;\nFor by some freakful chance he made retire\nFrom his companions, and set forth to walk,\nPerhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:\nOver the solitary hills he fared,\nThoughtless at first, but ere eve\u2019s star appeared\nHis phantasy was lost, where reason fades,\nIn the calm\u2019d twilight of Platonic shades.\nLamia beheld him coming, near, more near\u2014\nClose to her passing, in indifference drear,\nHis silent sandals swept the mossy green;\nSo neighbour\u2019d to him, and yet so unseen\nShe stood: he pass\u2019d, shut up in mysteries,\nHis mind wrapp\u2019d like his mantle, while her eyes\nTurn\u2019d\u2014syllabling thus, \u201cAh, Lycius bright,\n\u201cAnd will you leave me on the hills alone?\n\u201cLycius, look back! and be some pity shown.\u201d\nHe did; not with cold wonder fearingly,\nBut Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;\nFor so delicious were the words she sung,\nIt seem\u2019d he had lov\u2019d them a whole summer long:\nAnd soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,\nLeaving no drop in the bewildering cup,\nAnd still the cup was full,\u2014while he afraid\nLest she should vanish ere his lip had paid\nDue adoration, thus began to adore;\nHer soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure:\n\u201cLeave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see\n\u201cWhether my eyes can ever turn from thee!\n\u201cFor pity do not this sad heart belie\u2014\n\u201cEven as thou vanishest so I shall die.\n\u201cStay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay!\n\u201cTo thy far wishes will thy streams obey:\n\u201cStay! though the greenest woods be thy domain,\n\u201cAlone they can drink up the morning rain:\n\u201cThough a descended Pleiad, will not one\n\u201cOf thine harmonious sisters keep in tune\n\u201cThy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?\n\u201cSo sweetly to these ravish\u2019d ears of mine\n\u201cCame thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade\n\u201cThy memory will waste me to a shade:\u2014\n\u201cFor pity do not melt!\u201d\u2014\u201cIf I should stay,\u201d\nSaid Lamia, \u201chere, upon this floor of clay,\n\u201cAnd pain my steps upon these flowers too rough,\n\u201cWhat canst thou say or do of charm enough\n\u201cTo dull the nice remembrance of my home?\n\u201cThou canst not ask me with thee here to roam\n\u201cOver these hills and vales, where no joy is,\u2014\n\u201cEmpty of immortality and bliss!\n\u201cThou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know\n\u201cThat finer spirits cannot breathe below\n\u201cIn human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth,\n\u201cWhat taste of purer air hast thou to soothe\n\u201cMy essence? What serener palaces,\n\u201cWhere I may all my many senses please,\n\u201cAnd by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?\n\u201cIt cannot be\u2014Adieu!\u201d So said, she rose\nTiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose\nThe amorous promise of her lone complain,\nSwoon\u2019d, murmuring of love, and pale with pain.\nThe cruel lady, without any show\nOf sorrow for her tender favourite\u2019s woe,\nBut rather, if her eyes could brighter be,\nWith brighter eyes and slow amenity,\nPut her new lips to his, and gave afresh\nThe life she had so tangled in her mesh:\nAnd as he from one trance was wakening\nInto another, she began to sing,\nHappy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,\nA song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres,\nWhile, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires\nAnd then she whisper\u2019d in such trembling tone,\nAs those who, safe together met alone\nFor the first time through many anguish\u2019d days,\nUse other speech than looks; bidding him raise\nHis drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,\nFor that she was a woman, and without\nAny more subtle fluid in her veins\nThan throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains\nInhabited her frail-strung heart as his.\nAnd next she wonder\u2019d how his eyes could miss\nHer face so long in Corinth, where, she said,\nShe dwelt but half retir\u2019d, and there had led\nDays happy as the gold coin could invent\nWithout the aid of love; yet in content\nTill she saw him, as once she pass\u2019d him by,\nWhere \u2019gainst a column he leant thoughtfully\nAt Venus\u2019 temple porch, \u2019mid baskets heap\u2019d\nOf amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap\u2019d\nLate on that eve, as \u2019twas the night before\nThe Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more,\nBut wept alone those days, for why should she adore?\nLycius from death awoke into amaze,\nTo see her still, and singing so sweet lays;\nThen from amaze into delight he fell\nTo hear her whisper woman\u2019s lore so well;\nAnd every word she spake entic\u2019d him on\nTo unperplex\u2019d delight and pleasure known.\nLet the mad poets say whate\u2019er they please\nOf the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses,\nThere is not such a treat among them all,\nHaunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,\nAs a real woman, lineal indeed\nFrom Pyrrha\u2019s pebbles or old Adam\u2019s seed.\nThus gentle Lamia judg\u2019d, and judg\u2019d aright,\nThat Lycius could not love in half a fright,\nSo threw the goddess off, and won his heart\nMore pleasantly by playing woman\u2019s part,\nWith no more awe than what her beauty gave,\nThat, while it smote, still guaranteed to save.\nLycius to all made eloquent reply,\nMarrying to every word a twinborn sigh;\nAnd last, pointing to Corinth, ask\u2019d her sweet,\nIf \u2019twas too far that night for her soft feet.\nThe way was short, for Lamia\u2019s eagerness\nMade, by a spell, the triple league decrease\nTo a few paces; not at all surmised\nBy blinded Lycius, so in her comprized.\nThey pass\u2019d the city gates, he knew not how\nSo noiseless, and he never thought to know.\nAs men talk in a dream, so Corinth all,\nThroughout her palaces imperial,\nAnd all her populous streets and temples lewd,\nMutter\u2019d, like tempest in the distance brew\u2019d,\nTo the wide-spreaded night above her towers.\nMen, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,\nShuffled their sandals o\u2019er the pavement white,\nCompanion\u2019d or alone; while many a light\nFlared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,\nAnd threw their moving shadows on the walls,\nOr found them cluster\u2019d in the corniced shade\nOf some arch\u2019d temple door, or dusky colonnade.\nMuffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,\nHer fingers he press\u2019d hard, as one came near\nWith curl\u2019d gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,\nSlow-stepp\u2019d, and robed in philosophic gown:\nLycius shrank closer, as they met and past,\nInto his mantle, adding wings to haste,\nWhile hurried Lamia trembled: \u201cAh,\u201d said he,\n\u201cWhy do you shudder, love, so ruefully?\n\u201cWhy does your tender palm dissolve in dew?\u201d\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019m wearied,\u201d said fair Lamia: \u201ctell me who\n\u201cIs that old man? I cannot bring to mind\n\u201cHis features:\u2014Lycius! wherefore did you blind\n\u201cYourself from his quick eyes?\u201d Lycius replied,\n\u201c\u2019Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide\n\u201cAnd good instructor; but to-night he seems\n\u201cThe ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams.\nWhile yet he spake they had arrived before\nA pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,\nWhere hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow\nReflected in the slabbed steps below,\nMild as a star in water; for so new,\nAnd so unsullied was the marble hue,\nSo through the crystal polish, liquid fine,\nRan the dark veins, that none but feet divine\nCould e'er have touch'd there. Sounds Aeolian\nBreath'd from the hinges, as the ample span\nOf the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown\nSome time to any, but those two alone,\nAnd a few Persian mutes, who that same year\nWere seen about the markets: none knew where\nThey could inhabit; the most curious\nWere foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house:\nAnd but the flitter-winged verse must tell,\nFor truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,\n'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,\nShut from the busy world of more incredulous.\n(line 48): Originally, \"Cerulean-spotted.\" Leigh Hunt says of this passage, \"The admiration, pity, and horror, to be excited by humanity in a brute shape, were never perhaps called upon by a greater mixture of beauty and deformity than in the picture of this creature. Our pity and suspicions are begged by the first word: the profuse and vital beauties with which she is covered seem proportioned to her misery and natural rights; and lest we should lose sight of them in this gorgeousness, the 'woman's mouth' fills us at once with shuddering and compassion.\"\n(line 158): The manuscript reads \"vulcanian,\" the first edition \"volcanian.\" It seems to me more likely that the manuscript accords with the poet's intention than that printed text does, for this old orthography is the more characteristic of the vocabulary of this particular poem, as introducing the more conspicuously the mythic personal origin of the common noun \"volcano\" or \"vulcano.\"\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

Winter is come and gone,\nBut grief returns with the revolving year;\nThe airs and streams renew their joyous tone;\nThe ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;\nFresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Season's bier;\nThe amorous birds now pair in every brake,\nAnd build their mossy homes in field and brere;\nAnd the green lizard, and the golden snake,\nLike unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.\nXIX.\nThrough wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean\nA quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst\nAs it has ever done, with change and motion,\nFrom the great morning of the world when first\nGod dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,\nThe lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;\nAll baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;\nDiffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight\nThe beauty and the joy of their renewed might.\nXX.\nThe leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,\nExhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;\nLike incarnations of the stars, when splendour\nIs changed to fragrance, they illumine death\nAnd mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;\nNought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows\nBe as a sword consumed before the sheath\nBy sightless lightning? -the intense atom glows\nA moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.\nXXI.\nAlas! that all we loved of him should be,\nBut for our grief, as if it had not been,\nAnd grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!\nWhence are we, and why are we? of what scene\nThe actors or spectators?

{"title": "Alastor: or, the Spirit of Solitude", "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "text": "Earth, Ocean, Air, belov\u00e8d brotherhood!\nIf our great Mother has imbued my soul\nWith aught of natural piety to feel\nYour love, and recompense the boon with mine;\nIf dewy morn, and odorous noon, and even,\nWith sunset and its gorgeous ministers,\nAnd solemn midnight's tingling silentness;\nIf Autumn's hollow sighs in the sere wood,\nAnd Winter robing with pure snow and crowns\nOf starry ice the gray grass and bare boughs;\nIf Spring's voluptuous pantings when she breathes\nHer first sweet kisses,\u2014have been dear to me;\nIf no bright bird, insect, or gentle beast\nI consciously have injured, but still loved\nAnd cherished these my kindred; then forgive\nThis boast, belov\u00e8d brethren, and withdraw\nNo portion of your wonted favor now!\nMother of this unfathomable world!\nFavor my solemn song, for I have loved\nThee ever, and thee only; I have watched\nThy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps,\nAnd my heart ever gazes on the depth\nOf thy deep mysteries. I have made my bed\nIn charnels and on coffins, where black death\nKeeps record of the trophies won from thee,\nHoping to still these obstinate questionings\nOf thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost,\nThy messenger, to render up the tale\nOf what we are. In lone and silent hours,\nWhen night makes a weird sound of its own stillness,\nLike an inspired and desperate alchemist\nStaking his very life on some dark hope,\nHave I mixed awful talk and asking looks\nWith my most innocent love, until strange tears,\nUniting with those breathless kisses, made\nSuch magic as compels the charm\u00e8d night\nTo render up thy charge; and, though ne'er yet\nThou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary,\nEnough from incommunicable dream,\nAnd twilight phantasms, and deep noonday thought,\nHas shone within me, that serenely now\nAnd moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre\nSuspended in the solitary dome\nOf some mysterious and deserted fane,\nI wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain\nMay modulate with murmurs of the air,\nAnd motions of the forests and the sea,\nAnd voice of living beings, and woven hymns\nOf night and day, and the deep heart of man.\nThere was a Poet whose untimely tomb\nNo human hands with pious reverence reared,\nBut the charmed eddies of autumnal winds\nBuilt o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid\nOf mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:\nA lovely youth,\u2014no mourning maiden decked\nWith weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,\nThe lone couch of his everlasting sleep:\nGentle, and brave, and generous,\u2014no lorn bard\nBreathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh:\nHe lived, he died, he sung in solitude.\nStrangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,\nAnd virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined\nAnd wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.\nThe fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,\nAnd Silence, too enamoured of that voice,\nLocks its mute music in her rugged cell.\nBy solemn vision and bright silver dream\nHis infancy was nurtured. Every sight\nAnd sound from the vast earth and ambient air\nSent to his heart its choicest impulses.\nThe fountains of divine philosophy\nFled not his thirsting lips, and all of great,\nOr good, or lovely, which the sacred past\nIn truth or fable consecrates, he felt\nAnd knew. When early youth had passed, he left\nHis cold fireside and alienated home\nTo seek strange truths in undiscovered lands.\nMany a wide waste and tangled wilderness\nHas lured his fearless steps; and he has bought\nWith his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men,\nHis rest and food. Nature's most secret steps\nHe like her shadow has pursued, where'er\nThe red volcano overcanopies\nIts fields of snow and pinnacles of ice\nWith burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes\nOn black bare pointed islets ever beat\nWith sluggish surge, or where the secret caves,\nRugged and dark, winding among the springs\nOf fire and poison, inaccessible\nTo avarice or pride, their starry domes\nOf diamond and of gold expand above\nNumberless and immeasurable halls,\nFrequent with crystal column, and clear shrines\nOf pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite.\nNor had that scene of ampler majesty\nThan gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven\nAnd the green earth, lost in his heart its claims\nTo love and wonder; he would linger long\nIn lonesome vales, making the wild his home,\nUntil the doves and squirrels would partake\nFrom his innocuous band his bloodless food,\nLured by the gentle meaning of his looks,\nAnd the wild antelope, that starts whene'er\nThe dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend\nHer timid steps, to gaze upon a form\nMore graceful than her own.\nHis wandering step,\nObedient to high thoughts, has visited\nThe awful ruins of the days of old:\nAthens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste\nWhere stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers\nOf Babylon, the eternal pyramids,\nMemphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange,\nSculptured on alabaster obelisk\nOr jasper tomb or mutilated sphinx,\nDark \u00c6thiopia in her desert hills\nConceals. Among the ruined temples there,\nStupendous columns, and wild images\nOf more than man, where marble daemons watch\nThe Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men\nHang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around,\nHe lingered, poring on memorials\nOf the world's youth: through the long burning day\nGazed on those speechless shapes; nor, when the moon\nFilled the mysterious halls with floating shades\nSuspended he that task, but ever gazed\nAnd gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind\nFlashed like strong inspiration, and he saw\nThe thrilling secrets of the birth of time.\nMeanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,\nHer daily portion, from her father's tent,\nAnd spread her matting for his couch, and stole\nFrom duties and repose to tend his steps,\nEnamoured, yet not daring for deep awe\nTo speak her love, and watched his nightly sleep,\nSleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips\nParted in slumber, whence the regular breath\nOf innocent dreams arose; then, when red morn\nMade paler the pale moon, to her cold home\nWildered, and wan, and panting, she returned.\nThe Poet, wandering on, through Arabie,\nAnd Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,\nAnd o'er the a\u00ebrial mountains which pour down\nIndus and Oxus from their icy caves,\nIn joy and exultation held his way;\nTill in the vale of Cashmire, far within\nIts loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine\nBeneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,\nBeside a sparkling rivulet he stretched\nHis languid limbs. A vision on his sleep\nThere came, a dream of hopes that never yet\nHad flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veil\u00e8d maid\nSate near him, talking in low solemn tones.\nHer voice was like the voice of his own soul\nHeard in the calm of thought; its music long,\nLike woven sounds of streams and breezes, held\nHis inmost sense suspended in its web\nOf many-colored woof and shifting hues.\nKnowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,\nAnd lofty hopes of divine liberty,\nThoughts the most dear to him, and poesy,\nHerself a poet. Soon the solemn mood\nOf her pure mind kindled through all her frame\nA permeating fire; wild numbers then\nShe raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs\nSubdued by its own pathos; her fair hands\nWere bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp\nStrange symphony, and in their branching veins\nThe eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.\nThe beating of her heart was heard to fill\nThe pauses of her music, and her breath\nTumultuously accorded with those fits\nOf intermitted song. Sudden she rose,\nAs if her heart impatiently endured\nIts bursting burden; at the sound he turned,\nAnd saw by the warm light of their own life\nHer glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil\nOf woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,\nHer dark locks floating in the breath of night,\nHer beamy bending eyes, her parted lips\nOutstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly.\nHis strong heart sunk and sickened with excess\nOf love. He reared his shuddering limbs, and quelled\nHis gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet\nHer panting bosom:\u2014she drew back awhile,\nThen, yielding to the irresistible joy,\nWith frantic gesture and short breathless cry\nFolded his frame in her dissolving arms.\nNow blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night\nInvolved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,\nLike a dark flood suspended in its course,\nRolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.\nRoused by the shock, he started from his trance\u2014\nThe cold white light of morning, the blue moon\nLow in the west, the clear and garish hills,\nThe distinct valley and the vacant woods,\nSpread round him where he stood. Whither have fled\nThe hues of heaven that canopied his bower\nOf yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep,\nThe mystery and the majesty of Earth,\nThe joy, the exultation? His wan eyes\nGaze on the empty scene as vacantly\nAs ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven.\nThe spirit of sweet human love has sent\nA vision to the sleep of him who spurned\nHer choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues\nBeyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade;\nHe overleaps the bounds. Alas! alas!\nWere limbs and breath and being intertwined\nThus treacherously? Lost, lost, forever lost\nIn the wide pathless desert of dim sleep,\nThat beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death\nConduct to thy mysterious paradise,\nO Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds\nAnd pendent mountains seen in the calm lake\nLead only to a black and watery depth,\nWhile death's blue vault with loathliest vapors hung,\nWhere every shade which the foul grave exhales\nHides its dead eye from the detested day,\nConducts, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms?\nThis doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart;\nThe insatiate hope which it awakened stung\nHis brain even like despair.\nWhile daylight held\nThe sky, the Poet kept mute conference\nWith his still soul. At night the passion came,\nLike the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,\nAnd shook him from his rest, and led him forth\nInto the darkness. As an eagle, grasped\nIn folds of the green serpent, feels her breast\nBurn with the poison, and precipitates\nThrough night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud,\nFrantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight\nO'er the wide a\u00ebry wilderness: thus driven\nBy the bright shadow of that lovely dream,\nBeneath the cold glare of the desolate night,\nThrough tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,\nStartling with careless step the moon-light snake,\nHe fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,\nShedding the mockery of its vital hues\nUpon his cheek of death. He wandered on\nTill vast Aornos seen from Petra's steep\nHung o'er the low horizon like a cloud;\nThrough Balk, and where the desolated tombs\nOf Parthian kings scatter to every wind\nTheir wasting dust, wildly he wandered on,\nDay after day, a weary waste of hours,\nBearing within his life the brooding care\nThat ever fed on its decaying flame.\nAnd now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair,\nSered by the autumn of strange suffering,\nSung dirges in the wind; his listless hand\nHung like dead bone within its withered skin;\nLife, and the lustre that consumed it, shone,\nAs in a furnace burning secretly,\nFrom his dark eyes alone. The cottagers,\nWho ministered with human charity\nHis human wants, beheld with wondering awe\nTheir fleeting visitant. The mountaineer,\nEncountering on some dizzy precipice\nThat spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of Wind,\nWith lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet\nDisturbing not the drifted snow, had paused\nIn its career; the infant would conceal\nHis troubled visage in his mother's robe\nIn terror at the glare of those wild eyes,\nTo remember their strange light in many a dream\nOf after times; but youthful maidens, taught\nBy nature, would interpret half the woe\nThat wasted him, would call him with false names\nBrother and friend, would press his pallid hand\nAt parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path\nOf his departure from their father's door.\nAt length upon the lone Chorasmian shore\nHe paused, a wide and melancholy waste\nOf putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged\nHis steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,\nBeside a sluggish stream among the reeds.\nIt rose as he approached, and, with strong wings\nScaling the upward sky, bent its bright course\nHigh over the immeasurable main.\nHis eyes pursued its flight:\u2014'Thou hast a home,\nBeautiful bird! thou voyagest to thine home,\nWhere thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck\nWith thine, and welcome thy return with eyes\nBright in the lustre of their own fond joy.\nAnd what am I that I should linger here,\nWith voice far sweeter than thy dying notes,\nSpirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned\nTo beauty, wasting these surpassing powers\nIn the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven\nThat echoes not my thoughts?' A gloomy smile\nOf desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips.\nFor sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly\nIts precious charge, and silent death exposed,\nFaithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure,\nWith doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms.\nStartled by his own thoughts, he looked around.\nThere was no fair fiend near him, not a sight\nOr sound of awe but in his own deep mind.\nA little shallop floating near the shore\nCaught the impatient wandering of his gaze.\nIt had been long abandoned, for its sides\nGaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints\nSwayed with the undulations of the tide.\nA restless impulse urged him to embark\nAnd meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste;\nFor well he knew that mighty Shadow loves\nThe slimy caverns of the populous deep.\nThe day was fair and sunny; sea and sky\nDrank its inspiring radiance, and the wind\nSwept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves.\nLeaped in the boat; he spread his cloak aloft\nOn the bare mast, and took his lonely seat,\nAnd felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea\nLike a torn cloud before the hurricane.\nAs one that in a silver vision floats\nObedient to the sweep of odorous winds\nUpon resplendent clouds, so rapidly\nAlong the dark and ruffled waters fled\nThe straining boat. A whirlwind swept it on,\nWith fierce gusts and precipitating force,\nThrough the white ridges of the chaf\u00e8d sea.\nThe waves arose. Higher and higher still\nTheir fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge\nLike serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp.\nCalm and rejoicing in the fearful war\nOf wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast\nDescending, and black flood on whirlpool driven\nWith dark obliterating course, he sate:\nAs if their genii were the ministers\nAppointed to conduct him to the light\nOf those belov\u00e8d eyes, the Poet sate,\nHolding the steady helm. Evening came on;\nThe beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues\nHigh 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray\nThat canopied his path o'er the waste deep;\nTwilight, ascending slowly from the east,\nEntwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks\nO'er the fair front and radiant eyes of Day;\nMore horribly the multitudinous streams\nOf ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war\nRushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock\nThe calm and spangled sky. The little boat\nStill fled before the storm; still fled, like foam\nDown the steep cataract of a wintry river;\nNow pausing on the edge of the riven wave;\nNow leaving far behind the bursting mass\nThat fell, convulsing ocean; safely fled\u2014\nAs if that frail and wasted human form\nHad been an elemental god.\nAt midnight\nThe moon arose; and lo! the ethereal cliffs\nOf Caucasus, whose icy summits shone\nAmong the stars like sunlight, and around\nWhose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves\nBursting and eddying irresistibly\nRage and resound forever.\u2014Who shall save?\u2014\nThe boat fled on,\u2014the boiling torrent drove,\u2014\nThe crags closed round with black and jagged arms,\nThe shattered mountain overhung the sea,\nAnd faster still, beyond all human speed,\nSuspended on the sweep of the smooth wave,\nThe little boat was driven. A cavern there\nYawned, and amid its slant and winding depths\nIngulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on\nWith unrelaxing speed.\u2014'Vision and Love!'\nThe Poet cried aloud, 'I have beheld\nThe path of thy departure. Sleep and death\nShall not divide us long.'\nThe boat pursued\nThe windings of the cavern. Daylight shone\nAt length upon that gloomy river's flow;\nNow, where the fiercest war among the waves\nIs calm, on the unfathomable stream\nThe boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven,\nExposed those black depths to the azure sky,\nEre yet the flood's enormous volume fell\nEven to the base of Caucasus, with sound\nThat shook the everlasting rocks, the mass\nFilled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm;\nStair above stair the eddying waters rose,\nCircling immeasurably fast, and laved\nWith alternating dash the gnarl\u00e8d roots\nOf mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms\nIn darkness over it. I' the midst was left,\nReflecting yet distorting every cloud,\nA pool of treacherous and tremendous calm.\nSeized by the sway of the ascending stream,\nWith dizzy swiftness, round and round and round,\nRidge after ridge the straining boat arose,\nTill on the verge of the extremest curve,\nWhere through an opening of the rocky bank\nThe waters overflow, and a smooth spot\nOf glassy quiet 'mid those battling tides\nIs left, the boat paused shuddering.\u2014Shall it sink\nDown the abyss? Shall the reverting stress\nOf that resistless gulf embosom it?\nNow shall it fall?\u2014A wandering stream of wind\nBreathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,\nAnd, lo! with gentle motion between banks\nOf mossy slope, and on a placid stream,\nBeneath a woven grove, it sails, and, hark!\nThe ghastly torrent mingles its far roar\nWith the breeze murmuring in the musical woods.\nWhere the embowering trees recede, and leave\nA little space of green expanse, the cove\nIs closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers\nForever gaze on their own drooping eyes,\nReflected in the crystal calm. The wave\nOf the boat's motion marred their pensive task,\nWhich naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind,\nOr falling spear-grass, or their own decay\nHad e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed\nTo deck with their bright hues his withered hair,\nBut on his heart its solitude returned,\nAnd he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid\nIn those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame,\nHad yet performed its ministry; it hung\nUpon his life, as lightning in a cloud\nGleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods\nOf night close over it.\nThe noonday sun\nNow shone upon the forest, one vast mass\nOf mingling shade, whose brown magnificence\nA narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves,\nScooped in the dark base of their a\u00ebry rocks,\nMocking its moans, respond and roar forever.\nThe meeting boughs and implicated leaves\nWove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as, led\nBy love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death,\nHe sought in Nature's dearest haunt some bank,\nHer cradle and his sepulchre. More dark\nAnd dark the shades accumulate. The oak,\nExpanding its immense and knotty arms,\nEmbraces the light beech. The pyramids\nOf the tall cedar overarching frame\nMost solemn domes within, and far below,\nLike clouds suspended in an emerald sky,\nThe ash and the acacia floating hang\nTremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed\nIn rainbow and in fire, the parasites,\nStarred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around\nThe gray trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,\nWith gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,\nFold their beams round the hearts of those that love,\nThese twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs,\nUniting their close union; the woven leaves\nMake network of the dark blue light of day\nAnd the night's noontide clearness, mutable\nAs shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns\nBeneath these canopies extend their swells,\nFragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms\nMinute yet beautiful. One darkest glen\nSends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine\nA soul-dissolving odor to invite\nTo some more lovely mystery. Through the dell\nSilence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep\nTheir noonday watch, and sail among the shades,\nLike vaporous shapes half-seen; beyond, a well,\nDark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave,\nImages all the woven boughs above,\nAnd each depending leaf, and every speck\nOf azure sky darting between their chasms;\nNor aught else in the liquid mirror laves\nIts portraiture, but some inconstant star,\nBetween one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,\nOr painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,\nOr gorgeous insect floating motionless,\nUnconscious of the day, ere yet his wings\nHave spread their glories to the gaze of noon.\nHither the Poet came. His eyes beheld\nTheir own wan light through the reflected lines\nOf his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth\nOf that still fountain; as the human heart,\nGazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,\nSees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard\nThe motion of the leaves\u2014the grass that sprung\nStartled and glanced and trembled even to feel\nAn unaccustomed presence\u2014and the sound\nOf the sweet brook that from the secret springs\nOf that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed\nTo stand beside him\u2014clothed in no bright robes\nOf shadowy silver or enshrining light,\nBorrowed from aught the visible world affords\nOf grace, or majesty, or mystery;\nBut undulating woods, and silent well,\nAnd leaping rivulet, and evening gloom\nNow deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,\nHeld commune with him, as if he and it\nWere all that was; only\u2014when his regard\nWas raised by intense pensiveness\u2014two eyes,\nTwo starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought,\nAnd seemed with their serene and azure smiles\nTo beckon him.\nObedient to the light\nThat shone within his soul, he went, pursuing\nThe windings of the dell. The rivulet,\nWanton and wild, through many a green ravine\nBeneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell\nAmong the moss with hollow harmony\nDark and profound. Now on the polished stones\nIt danced, like childhood laughing as it went;\nThen, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept,\nReflecting every herb and drooping bud\nThat overhung its quietness.\u2014'O stream!\nWhose source is inaccessibly profound,\nWhither do thy mysterious waters tend?\nThou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,\nThy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,\nThy searchless fountain and invisible course,\nHave each their type in me; and the wide sky\nAnd measureless ocean may declare as soon\nWhat oozy cavern or what wandering cloud\nContains thy waters, as the universe\nTell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched\nUpon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste\nI' the passing wind!'\nBeside the grassy shore\nOf the small stream he went; he did impress\nOn the green moss his tremulous step, that caught\nStrong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one\nRoused by some joyous madness from the couch\nOf fever, he did move; yet not like him\nForgetful of the grave, where, when the flame\nOf his frail exultation shall be spent,\nHe must descend. With rapid steps he went\nBeneath the shade of trees, beside the flow\nOf the wild babbling rivulet; and now\nThe forest's solemn canopies were changed\nFor the uniform and lightsome evening sky.\nGray rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed\nThe struggling brook; tall spires of windlestrae\nThrew their thin shadows down the rugged slope,\nAnd nought but gnarl\u00e8d roots of ancient pines\nBranchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots\nThe unwilling soil. A gradual change was here\nYet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,\nThe smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin\nAnd white, and where irradiate dewy eyes\nHad shone, gleam stony orbs:\u2014so from his steps\nBright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade\nOf the green groves, with all their odorous winds\nAnd musical motions. Calm he still pursued\nThe stream, that with a larger volume now\nRolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there\nFretted a path through its descending curves\nWith its wintry speed. On every side now rose\nRocks, which, in unimaginable forms,\nLifted their black and barren pinnacles\nIn the light of evening, and its precipice\nObscuring the ravine, disclosed above,\n'Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves,\nWhose windings gave ten thousand various tongues\nTo the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands\nIts stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,\nAnd seems with its accumulated crags\nTo overhang the world; for wide expand\nBeneath the wan stars and descending moon\nIslanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,\nDim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom\nOf leaden-colored even, and fiery hills\nMingling their flames with twilight, on the verge\nOf the remote horizon. The near scene,\nIn naked and severe simplicity,\nMade contrast with the universe. A pine,\nRock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy\nIts swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast\nYielding one only response at each pause\nIn most familiar cadence, with the howl,\nThe thunder and the hiss of homeless streams\nMingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river\nFoaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,\nFell into that immeasurable void,\nScattering its waters to the passing winds.\nYet the gray precipice and solemn pine\nAnd torrent were not all;\u2014one silent nook\nWas there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,\nUpheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,\nIt overlooked in its serenity\nThe dark earth and the bending vault of stars.\nIt was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile\nEven in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped\nThe fissured stones with its entwining arms,\nAnd did embower with leaves forever green\nAnd berries dark the smooth and even space\nOf its inviolated floor; and here\nThe children of the autumnal whirlwind bore\nIn wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay,\nRed, yellow, or ethereally pale,\nRivals the pride of summer. 'T is the haunt\nOf every gentle wind whose breath can teach\nThe wilds to love tranquillity. One step,\nOne human step alone, has ever broken\nThe stillness of its solitude; one voice\nAlone inspired its echoes;\u2014even that voice\nWhich hither came, floating among the winds,\nAnd led the loveliest among human forms\nTo make their wild haunts the depository\nOf all the grace and beauty that endued\nIts motions, render up its majesty,\nScatter its music on the unfeeling storm,\nAnd to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,\nNurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,\nCommit the colors of that varying cheek,\nThat snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes.\nThe dim and horn\u00e8d moon hung low, and poured\nA sea of lustre on the horizon's verge\nThat overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist\nFilled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank\nWan moonlight even to fulness; not a star\nShone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,\nDanger's grim playmates, on that precipice\nSlept, clasped in his embrace.\u2014O storm of death,\nWhose sightless speed divides this sullen night!\nAnd thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still\nGuiding its irresistible career\nIn thy devastating omnipotence,\nArt king of this frail world! from the red field\nOf slaughter, from the reeking hospital,\nThe patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed\nOf innocence, the scaffold and the throne,\nA mighty voice invokes thee! Ruin calls\nHis brother Death! A rare and regal prey\nHe hath prepared, prowling around the world;\nGlutted with which thou mayst repose, and men\nGo to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,\nNor ever more offer at thy dark shrine\nThe unheeded tribute of a broken heart.\nWhen on the threshold of the green recess\nThe wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death\nWas on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,\nDid he resign his high and holy soul\nTo images of the majestic past,\nThat paused within his passive being now,\nLike winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe\nThrough some dim latticed chamber. He did place\nHis pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk\nOf the old pine; upon an ivied stone\nReclined his languid head; his limbs did rest,\nDiffused and motionless, on the smooth brink\nOf that obscurest chasm;\u2014and thus he lay,\nSurrendering to their final impulses\nThe hovering powers of life. Hope and Despair,\nThe torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear\nMarred his repose; the influxes of sense\nAnd his own being, unalloyed by pain,\nYet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed\nThe stream of thought, till he lay breathing there\nAt peace, and faintly smiling. His last sight\nWas the great moon, which o'er the western line\nOf the wide world her mighty horn suspended,\nWith whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed\nTo mingle. Now upon the jagged hills\nIt rests; and still as the divided frame\nOf the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood,\nThat ever beat in mystic sympathy\nWith Nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still;\nAnd when two lessening points of light alone\nGleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp\nOf his faint respiration scarce did stir\nThe stagnate night:\u2014till the minutest ray\nWas quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart.\nIt paused\u2014it fluttered. But when heaven remained\nUtterly black, the murky shades involved\nAn image silent, cold, and motionless,\nAs their own voiceless earth and vacant air.\nEven as a vapor fed with golden beams\nThat ministered on sunlight, ere the west\nEclipses it, was now that wondrous frame\u2014\nNo sense, no motion, no divinity\u2014\nA fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings\nThe breath of heaven did wander\u2014a bright stream\nOnce fed with many-voic\u00e8d waves\u2014a dream\nOf youth, which night and time have quenched forever\u2014\nStill, dark, and dry, and unremembered now.\nOh, for Medea's wondrous alchemy,\nWhich wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam\nWith bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale\nFrom vernal blooms fresh fragrance! Oh, that God,\nProfuse of poisons, would concede the chalice\nWhich but one living man has drained, who now,\nVessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels\nNo proud exemption in the blighting curse\nHe bears, over the world wanders forever,\nLone as incarnate death! Oh, that the dream\nOf dark magician in his visioned cave,\nRaking the cinders of a crucible\nFor life and power, even when his feeble hand\nShakes in its last decay, were the true law\nOf this so lovely world! But thou art fled,\nLike some frail exhalation, which the dawn\nRobes in its golden beams,\u2014ah! thou hast fled!\nThe brave, the gentle and the beautiful,\nThe child of grace and genius. Heartless things\nAre done and said i' the world, and many worms\nAnd beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth\nFrom sea and mountain, city and wilderness,\nIn vesper low or joyous orison,\nLifts still its solemn voice:\u2014but thou art fled\u2014\nThou canst no longer know or love the shapes\nOf this phantasmal scene, who have to thee\nBeen purest ministers, who are, alas!\nNow thou art not! Upon those pallid lips\nSo sweet even in their silence, on those eyes\nThat image sleep in death, upon that form\nYet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear\nBe shed\u2014not even in thought. Nor, when those hues\nAre gone, and those divinest lineaments,\nWorn by the senseless wind, shall live alone\nIn the frail pauses of this simple strain,\nLet not high verse, mourning the memory\nOf that which is no more, or painting's woe\nOr sculpture, speak in feeble imagery\nTheir own cold powers. Art and eloquence,\nAnd all the shows o' the world, are frail and vain\nTo weep a loss that turns their lights to shade.\nIt is a woe \"too deep for tears,\" when all\nIs reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,\nWhose light adorned the world around it, leaves\nThose who remain behind, not sobs or groans,\nThe passionate tumult of a clinging hope;\nBut pale despair and cold tranquillity,\nNature's vast frame, the web of human things,\nBirth and the grave, that are not as they were.\nComposed at Bishopsgate Heath, near Windsor Park, 1815 (autumn).\nNote by Mrs. Shelley: 'Alastor is written in a very different tone from Queen Mab. In the latter, Shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youth -- all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy, censure, and hope, to which the present suffering, and what he considers the proper destiny, of his fellow-creatures, gave birth.  Alastor, on the contrary, contains an individual interest only.  A very few years, with their attendant events, had checked the ardour of Shelley's hopes, though he still thought them well grounded, and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve.\nThis is neither the time nor the place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life. It will be sufficient to say that, in all he did, he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience; while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life. Physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward; inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad, and to make, as in Queen Mab, the whole universe the object and subject of his song.  In the Spring of 1815 an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption; abscesses were formed on his lungs, and he suffered acute spasms. suddenly a complete change took place; and, though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility, every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished.  His nerves, which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree, were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health.\nAs soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the Continent, he went abroad. He visited some of the more magnificent scenes of Switzerland, and returned to England from Lucerne, by the Reuss and the Rhine. The river-navigation enchanted him.  In his favourite poem of Thalaba, his imagination had been excited by a description of such a voyage. In the summer of 1815, after a tour along the southern coast of Devonshire and a visit to Clifton, he rented a house on Bishopgate Heath, on the borders of Windsor Forest, where he enjoyed several months of comparative health and tranquil happiness.  The later summer months were warm and dry.  Accompanied by a few friends, he visited the source of the Thames, making a voyage in a wherry from Winsdor to Crickdale.  His beautiful stanzas in the churchyard of Lechlade were written on that occasion.  Alastor was composed on his return. He spent his days under the oak-shades of Windsor Great Park; and the magnificent woodland was a fitting study to inspire the various descriptions of forest-scenery we find in the poem.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Alastor:-or,-the-Spirit-of-Solitude"}

found him with the dead,\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\nAnd murdered in her bed.\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\nIn a suit of shabby gray;\nA cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay;\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\nWith sails of silver by.\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\nWithin another ring,\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\nA great or little thing,\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n\"That fellow's got to swing.\"\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\nSuddenly seemed to reel,\nAnd the sky above my head became\nLike a casque of scorching steel;\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\nMy pain I could not feel.\nI only knew what haunted thought\nQuickened his step, and why\nHe looked upon the garish day\nWith such a wistful eye;\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\nYet each man kills the thing he loves,\nBy each let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\nSome with the hands of Gold:\nThe kindest use a knife, because\nThe dead so soon grow cold.\nSome love too little, some too long,\nSome sell, and others buy;\nSome do the deed with many tears,\nAnd some without a sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nYet each man does not die.\nHe does not die a death of shame\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\nNor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\nInto an empty space.\nHe does not sit with silent men\nWho watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\nAnd when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\nThe prison of its prey.\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\nDread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\nTo put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\nHe does not feel that sickening thirst\nThat sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\nComes through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\nHe does not bend his head to hear\nThe Burial Office read,\nNor, while the anguish of his soul\nTells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\nInto the hideous shed.\nHe does not stare upon the air\nThrough a little roof of glass:\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\nFor his agony to pass;\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\nThe kiss of Caiaphas.\nSix weeks the guardsman walked the yard,\nIn the suit of shabby gray:\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step was light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\nIts ravelled fleeces by.\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\nThose witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\nIn the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\nAnd drank the morning air.\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\nNor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\nSome healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\nAs though it had been wine!\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\nWho tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\nA great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\nThe man who had to swing.\nFor strange it was to see him pass\nWith a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\nSo wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\nHad such a debt to pay.\nThe oak and elm have pleasant leaves\nThat in the spring-time shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\nWith its alder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\nBefore it bears its fruit!\nThe loftiest place is the seat of grace\nFor which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\nUpon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\nHis last look at the sky?\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\nIs delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\nTo dance upon the air!\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\nWe watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\nWould end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\nHis sightless soul may stray.\nAt last the dead man walked no more\nAmongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\nFor weal or woe again.\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\nWe had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\nWe had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\nBut in the shameful day.\nA prison wall was round us both,\nTwo outcast men we were:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\nAnd God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\nHad caught us in its snare.\nIII\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\nBeneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a warder walked,\nFor fear the man might die.\nOr else he sat with those who watched\nHis anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\nThe Governor was strong upon\nThe Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\nA scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called,\nAnd left a little tract.\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\nNo hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\nThe hangman's day was near.\nBut why he said so strange a thing\nNo warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\nIs given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\nAnd make his face a mask.\nOr else he might be moved, and try\nTo comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\nWe trod the Fools' Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\nThe Devils' Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\nMake a merry masquerade.\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\nAnd clattered with the pails.\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\nWe turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\nAnd sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\nTerror was lying still.\nSo still it lay that every day\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\nThat waits for fool and knave,\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\nWe passed an open grave.\nWith yawning mouth the horrid hole\nGaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\nThe fellow had to swing.\nRight in we went, with soul intent\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\nWent shuffling through the gloom:\nAnd I trembled as I groped my way\nInto my numbered tomb.\nThat night the empty corridors\nWere full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\nStole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watchers watched him as he slept,\nAnd could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\nWith a hangman close at hand.\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\nWho never yet have wept:\nSo we- the fool, the fraud, the knave-\nThat endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\nAnother's terror crept.\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\nTo feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\nThe warders with their shoes of felt\nCrept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\nGray figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\nWho never prayed before.\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\nMad mourners of a corse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight shook\nLike the plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd as bitter wine upon a sponge\nWas the savour of Remorse.\nThe gray cock crew, the red cock crew,\nBut never came the day:\nAnd crooked shapes of Terror crouched,\nIn the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\nBefore us seemed to play.\nThey glided past, the glided fast,\nLike travellers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\nOf delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\nThey trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\nLike the wind upon the sand!\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\nAs their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and long they sang,\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\"Oho!\" they cried, \"the world is wide,\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\nIs a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\nIn the secret House of Shame.\"\nNo things of air these antics were,\nThat frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\nMost terrible to see.\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs;\nWith the mincing step of a demirep\nSome sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\nThe morning wind began to moan,\nBut still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\nCrept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\nThe weeping prison wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning steel\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\nTo have such a seneschal?\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars,\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\nAt seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\nThe prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\nHad entered in to kill.\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\nAre all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\nTo do the secret deed.\nWe were as men who through a fen\nOf filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\nOr to give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way\nAnd will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\nIt has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong\nThe monstrous parricide!\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\nThat makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\nFor the best man and the worst.\nWe had no other thing to do,\nSave to wait for the sign to come:\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick,\nLike a madman on a drum!\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\nSmote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\nOf impotent despair,\nLike the sound the frightened marshes hear\nFrom some leper in his lair.\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\nIn the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\nHooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\nStrangled into a scream.\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\nNone knew so well as I:\nFor he who lives more lives than one\nMore deaths that one must die.\nThere is no chapel on the day\nOn which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\nOr his face is far too wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\nWhich none should look upon.\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\nAnd then they rang the bell,\nAnd the warders with their jingling keys\nOpened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\nEach from his separate Hell.\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\nBut not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\nAnd that man's face was gray,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\nI never saw sad men who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWe prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every happy cloud that passed\nIn such strange freedom by.\nBut there were those amongst us all\nWho walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\nThey should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived,\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\nFor he who sins a second time\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud\nAnd makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\nWith crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd no man spoke a word.\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd through each hollow mind\nThe Memory of dreadful things\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\nAnd Terror crept behind.\nThe warders strutted up and down,\nAnd watched their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at,\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\nThere was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\nThat the man should have his pall.\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\nSuch as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\nNaked, for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\nAnd all the while the burning lime\nEats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bones by night,\nAnd the soft flesh by day,\nIt eats the flesh and bone by turns,\nBut it eats the heart alway.\nFor three long years they will not sow\nOr root or seedling there:\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\nWill sterile be and bare,\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\nWith unreproachful stare.\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\nEach simple seed they sow.\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\nIs kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but glow more red,\nThe white rose whiter blow.\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\nOut of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\nChrist brings His will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\nMay bloom in prison air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\nAre what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\nA common man's despair.\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\nPetal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\nThat God's Son died for all.\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\nStill hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit may not walk by night\nThat is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may but weep that lies\nIn such unholy ground,\nHe is at peace- this wretched man-\nAt peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\nThey did not even toll\nA requiem that might have brought\nRest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\nAnd hid him in a hole.\nThe warders stripped him of his clothes,\nAnd gave him to the flies:\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\nIn which the convict lies.\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\nBy his dishonoured grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\nWhom Christ came down to save.\nYet all is well; he has but passed\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourners be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn.\nI know not whether Laws be right,\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\nIs that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\nA year whose days are long.\nBut this I know, that every Law\nThat men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took His brother's life,\nAnd the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\nWith a most evil fan.\nThis too I know- and wise it were\nIf each could know the same-\nThat every prison that men build\nIs built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\nHow men their brothers maim.\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\nAnd the do well to hide their Hell,\nFor in it things are done\nThat Son of things nor son of Man\nEver should look upon!\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds\nBloom well in prison-air:\nIt is only what is good in Man\nThat wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\nAnd the warder is Despair.\nFor they starve the little frightened child\nTill it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\nAnd gibe the old and gray,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\nAnd none a word may say.\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\nIs a foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\nChokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\nIn Humanity's machine.\nThe brackish water that we drink\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\nIs full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\nWild-eyed, and cries to Time.\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\nLike asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\nFor what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\nBecomes one's heart by night.\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\nEach in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\nAnd never a human voice comes near\nTo speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\nIs pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\nWith soul and body marred.\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\nDegraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\nAnd some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\nAnd break the heart of stone.\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\nIn prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\nIts treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\nAh! happy they whose hearts can break\nAnd peace of pardon win!\nHow else may man make straight his plan\nAnd cleanse his soul from Sin?\nHow else but through a broken heart\nMay Lord Christ enter in?\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes,\nWaits for the holy hands that took\nThe Thief to Paradise;\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\nThe Lord will not despise.\nThe man in red who reads the Law\nGave him three weeks of life,\nThree little weeks in which to heal\nHis soul of his soul's strife,\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\nThe hand that held the knife.\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\nThe hand that held the steel:\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\nAnd only tears can heal:\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\nBecame Christ's snow-white seal.\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\nThere is a pit of shame,\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\nEaten by teeth of flame,\nIn a burning winding-sheet he lies,\nAnd his grave has got no name.\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\nIn silence let him lie:\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\nOr heave the windy sigh:\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\nAnd all men kill the thing they love,\nBy all let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Ballad-of-Reading-Gaol-II"}

Wisps of hay covered the floor,\nand some wasps sang at the windows, and maybe there was\na strange fluttering bird high above, disturbed, hoo-ing\na little and staring down from a messy ledge with wild,\nbinocular eyes.\nMostly, though, it smelled of milk, and the patience of\nanimals; the give-offs of the body were still in the air,\na vague ammonia, not unpleasant.\nMostly, though, it was restful and secret, the roof high\nup and arched, the boards unpainted and plain.\nYou could have stayed there forever, a small child in a corner,\non the last raft of hay, dazzled by so much space that seemed\nempty, but wasn't.\nThen--you still remember--you felt the rap of hunger--it was\nnoon--and you turned from that twilight dream and hurried back\nto the house, where the table was set, where an uncle patted you\non the shoulder for welcome, and there was your place at the table.\nNothing lasts.\nThere is a graveyard where everything I am talking about is,\nnow.\nI stood there once, on the green grass, scattering flowers.\nNothing is so delicate or so finely hinged as the wings\nof the green moth\nagainst the lantern\nagainst its heat\nagainst the beak of the crow\nin the early morning.\nYet the moth has trim, and feistiness, and not a drop\nof self-pity.\nNot in this world.\nMy mother\nwas the blue wisteria,\nmy mother\nwas the mossy stream out behind the house,\nmy mother, alas, alas,\ndid not always love her life,\nheavier than iron it was\nas she carried it in her arms, from room to room,\noh, unforgettable!\nI bury her\nin a box\nin the earth\nand turn away.\nMy father\nwas a demon of frustrated dreams,\nwas a breaker of trust,\nwas a poor, thin boy with bad luck.\nhe could talk to;\nhe swaggered before God, there being no one else\nwho would listen.\nListen,\nthis was his life.\nI bury it in the earth.\nI sweep the closets.\nI leave the house.\nI mention them now,\nI will not mention them again.\nIt is not lack of love\nnor lack of sorrow.\nBut the iron thing they carried, I will not carry.\nI give them--one, two, three, four--the kiss of courtesy,\nof sweet thanks,\nof anger, of good luck in the deep earth.\nMay they sleep well. May they soften.\nBut I will not give them the kiss of complicity.\nI will not give them the responsibility for my life.\nDid you know that the ant has a tongue\nwith which to gather in all that it can\nof sweetness?\nDid you know that?\nThe poem is not the world.\nIt isn't even the first page of the world.\nBut the poem wants to flower, like a flower.\nIt knows that much.\nIt wants to open itself,\nlike the door of a little temple,\nso that you might step inside and be cooled and refreshed,\nand less yourself than part of everything.\nThe voice of the child crying out of the mouth of the\ngrown woman\nis a misery and a disappointment.\nThe voice of the child howling out of the tall, bearded,\nmuscular man\nis a misery, and a terror.\n10.\nTherefore, tell me:\nwhat will engage you?\nWhat will open the dark fields of your mind,\nlike a lover\nat first touching?\n11.\nAnyway,\nthere was no barn.\nNo child in the barn.\nNo uncle no table no kitchen.\nOnly a long lovely field full of bobolinks.\n12.\nWhen loneliness comes stalking, go into the fields, consider\nthe orderliness of the world.

{"title": "Elegy I", "author": "Rainer Maria Rilke", "text": "Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'\nhierarchies? and even if one of them suddenly\npressed me against his heart, I would perish\nin the embrace of his stronger existence.\nFor beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror\nwhich we are barely able to endure and are awed\nbecause it serenely disdains to annihilate us.\nEach single angel is terrifying.\nAnd so I force myself, swallow and hold back\nthe surging call of my dark sobbing.\nNot angels, not humans;\nand even the knowing animals are aware that we feel\nlittle secure and at home in our interpreted world.\nThere remains perhaps some tree on a hillside\ndaily for us to see; yesterday's street remains for us\nstayed, moved in with us and showed no signs of leaving.\nOh, and the night, the night, when the wind\nfull of cosmic space invades our frightened faces.\nWhom would it not remain for -that longed-after,\ngently disenchanting night, painfully there for the\nsolitary heart to achieve? Is it easier for lovers?\nDon't you know yet ? Fling out of your arms the\nemptiness into the spaces we breath -perhaps the birds\nwill feel the expanded air in their more ferven flight.\nYes, the springtime were in need of you. Often a star\nwaited for you to espy it and sense its light.\nA wave rolled toward you out of the distant past,\nor as you walked below an open window,\na violin gave itself to your hearing.\nAll this was trust. But could you manage it?\nWere you not always distraught by expectation,\nas if all this were announcing the arrival\nof a beloved? \u00a0(Where would you find a place\nto hide her, with all your great strange thoughts\ncoming and going and often staying for the night.)\nWhen longing overcomes you, sing of women in love;\nfor their famous passion is far from immortal enough.\nThose whom you almost envy, the abandoned and\ndesolate ones, whom you found so much more loving\nthan those gratified. Begin ever new again\nthe praise you cannot attain; remember:\nthe hero lives on and survives; even his downfall\nwas for him only a pretext for achieving\nhis final birth. But nature, exhausted, takes lovers\nback into itself, as if such creative forces could never be\nachieved a second time.\nHave you thought of Gaspara Stampa sufficiently:\nthat any girl abandoned by her lover may feel\nfrom that far intenser example of loving:\n\"Ah, might I become like her!\" Should not their oldest\nsufferings finally become more fruitful for us?\nIs it not time that lovingly we freed ourselves\nfrom the beloved and, quivering, endured:\nas the arrow endures the bow-string's tension,\nand in this tense release becomes more than itself.\nFor staying is nowhere.\nVoices, voices. Listen my heart, as only saints\nhave listened: until the gigantic call lifted them\nclear off the ground. Yet they went on, impossibly,\nkneeling, completely unawares: so intense was\ntheir listening. Not that you could endure\nthe voice of God -far from it! But listen\nto the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message\nthat forms itself out of silence. They sweep\ntoward you now from those who died young.\nWhenever they entered a church in Rome or Naples,\ndid not their fate quietly speak to you as recently\nas the tablet did in Santa Maria Formosa?\nWhat do they want of me? to quietly remove\nthe appearance of suffered injustice that,\nat times, hinders a little their spirits from\nfreely proceeding onward.\nOf course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,\nto no longer use skills on had barely time to acquire;\nnot to observe roses and other things that promised\nso much in terms of a human future, no longer\nto be what one was in infinitely anxious hands;\nto even discard one's own name as easily as a child\nabandons a broken toy.\nStrange, not to desire to continue wishing one's wishes.\nStrange to notice all that was related, fluttering\nso loosely in space. And being dead is hard work\nand full of retrieving before one can gradually feel a\ntrace of eternity. -Yes, but the liviing make\nthe mistake of drawing too sharp a distinction.\nAngels (they say) are often unable to distinguish\nbetween moving among the living or the dead.\nThe eternal torrent whirls all ages along with it,\nthrough both realms forever, and their voices are lost in\nits thunderous roar.\nIn the end the early departed have no longer\nneed of us. One is gently weaned from things\nof this world as a child outgrows the need\nof its mother's breast. But we who have need\nof those great mysteries, we for whom grief is\nso often the source of spiritual growth,\ncould we exist without them?\nIs the legend vain that tells of music's beginning\nin the midst of the mourning for Linos?\nthe daring first sounds of song piercing\nthe barren numbness, and how in that stunned space\nan almost godlike youth suddenly left forever,\nand the emptiness felt for the first time\nthose harmonious vibrations which now enrapture\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Elegy-I"}

Now at last there is a play!\nThen what we separate can come together by our\nvery presence. And only then the entire cycle\nof our own life-seasons is revealed and set in motion.\nAbove, beyond us, the angel plays. Look:\nmust not the dying notice how unreal, how full\nof pretense is all that we accomplish here, where\nnothing is to be itself. O hours of childhood,\nwhen behind each shape more that the past lay hidden,\nwhen that which lay before us was not the future.\nWe grew, of course, and sometimes were impatient\nin growing up, \u00a0half for the sake of pleasing those\nwith nothing left but their own grown-upness.\nYet, when alone, we entertained ourselves\nwith what alone endures, we would stand there\nin the infinite space that spans the world and toys,\nupon a place, which from the first beginning\nhad been prepared to serve a pure event.\nWho shows a child just as it stands? Who places him\nwithin his constellation, with the measuring-rod\nof distance in his hand. Who makes his death\nfrom gray bread that grows hard, -or leaves\nit there inside his rounded mouth, jagged as the core\nof a sweet apple?\u2026\u2026.The minds of murderers\nare easily comprehended.

For it is not inertia alone\nthat is responsible for human relationships repeating\nthemselves from case to case, indescribably monotonous and\nunrenewed: it is shyness before any sort of new,unforeseeable\nexperience with which one does not think oneself able to cope.\nBut only someone who is ready for everything, who excludes\nnothing, not even the most enigmatical, will live the relation\nto another as something alive and will himself draw exhaustively\nfrom his own existence. For if we think of this existence of\nthe individual as a larger or smaller room, it appears evident\nthat most people learn to know only a corner of their room, a\nplace by the window, a strip of floor on which they walk up and\ndown. Thus they have a certain security. And yet that dangerous\ninsecurity is so much more human which drives the prisoners in\nPoe's stories to feel out the shapes of their horrible dungeons\nand not be strangers to the unspeakable terror of their abode.\nWe, however, are not prisoners. No traps or snares are set about\nus, and there is nothing which should intimidate or worry us.\nWe are set down in life as in the element to which we best\ncorrespond, and over and above this we have through thousands of\nyears of accommodation become so like this life, that when we\nhold still we are, through a happy mimicry,scarcely to be\ndistinguished from all that surrounds us.

{"title": "The Diary Of Ana\u00efs Nin, Volume 1: 1931-1934", "author": "Anais Nin", "text": "\"Am I, at bottom, that fervent little Spanish Catholic child who chastised herself for loving toys, who forbade herself the enjoyment of sweet foods, who practiced silence, who humiliated her pride, who adored symbols, statues, burning candles, incense, the caress of nuns, organ music, for whom Communion was a great event? I was so exalted by the idea of eating Jesus's flesh and drinking His blood that I couldn't swallow the host well, and I dreaded harming the it. I visualized Christ descending into my heart so realistically (I was a realist then!) that I could see Him walking down the stairs and entering the room of my heart like a sacred Visitor. That state of this room was a subject of great preoccupation for me. . . At the ages of nine, ten, eleven, I believe I approximated sainthood. And then, at sixteen, resentful of controls, disillusioned with a God who had not granted my prayers (the return of my father), who performed no miracles, who left me fatherless in a strange country, I rejected all Catholicism with exaggeration. Goodness, virtue, charity, submission, stifled me. I took up the words of Lawrence: \"They stress only pain, sacrifice, suffering and death. They do not dwell enough on the resurrection, on joy and life in the present.\" Today I feel my past like an unbearable weight, I feel that it interferes with my present life, that it must be the cause for this withdrawal, this closing of doors. . . I am embalmed because a nun leaned over me, enveloped me in her veils, kissed me. The chill curse of Christianity. I do not confess any more, I have no remorse, yet am I doing penance for my enjoyments? Nobody knows what a magnificent prey I was for Christian legends, because of my compassion and my tenderness for human beings. Today it divides me from enjoyment in life.\"\np. 70-71\n\"As June walked towards me from the darkness of the garden into the light of the door, I saw for the first time the most beautiful woman on earth. A startling white face, burning dark eyes, a face so alive I felt it would consume itself before my eyes. Years ago I tried to imagine true beauty; I created in my mind an image of just such a woman. I had never seen her until last night. Yet I knew long ago the phosphorescent color of her skin, her huntress profile, the evenness of her teeth. She is bizarre, fantastic, nervous, like someone in a high fever. Her beauty drowned me. As I sat before her, I felt I would do anything she asked of me. Henry suddenly faded. She was color and brilliance and strangeness. By the end of the evening I had extricated myself from her power. She killed my admiration by her talk. Her talk. The enormous ego, false, weak, posturing. She lacks the courage of her personality, which is sensual, heavy with experience. Her role alone preoccupies her. She invents dramas in which she always stars. I am sure she creates genuine dramas, genuine chaos and whirlpools of feelings, but I feel that her share in it is a pose. That night, in spite of my response to her, she sought to be whatever she felt I wanted her to be. She is an actress every moment. I cannot grasp the core of June. Everything Henry has said about her is true.\"\nI wanted to run out and kiss her fanatastic beauty and say: 'June, you have killed my sincerity too. I will never know again who I am, what I am, what I love, what I want. Your beauty has drowned me, the core of me. You carry away with you a part of me reflected in you. When your beauty struck me, it dissolved me. Deep down, I am not different from you. I dreamed you, I wished for your existance. You are the woman I want to be. I see in you that part of me which is you. I feel compassion for your childlike pride, for your trembling unsureness, your dramatization of events, your enhancing of the loves given to you.

{"title": "The Country of Marriage", "author": "Wendell Berry", "text": "I dream of you walking at night along the streams\nof the country of my birth, warm blooms and the nightsongs\nof birds opening around you as you walk.\nYou are holding in your body the dark seed of my sleep.\nII.\nThis comes after silence. Was it something I said\nthat bound me to you, some mere promise\nor, worse, the fear of loneliness and death?\nA man lost in the woods in the dark, I stood\nstill and said nothing. And then there rose in me,\nlike the earth's empowering brew rising\nin root and branch, the words of a dream of you\nI did not know I had dreamed. I was a wanderer\nwho feels the solace of his native land\nunder his feet again and moving in his blood.\nI went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped\nmy track was there to steady me. It was no abyss\nthat lay before me, but only the level ground.\nIII.\nSometimes our life reminds me\nof a forest in which there is a graceful clearing\nand in that opening a house,\nan orchard and garden,\ncomfortable shades, and flowers\nred and yellow in the sun, a pattern\nmade in the light for the light to return to.\nThe forest is mostly dark, its ways\nto be made anew day after day, the dark\nricher than the light and more blessed,\nprovided we stay brave\nenough to keep on going in.\nIV.\nHow many times have I come to you out of my head\nwith joy, if ever a man was,\nfor to approach you I have given up the light\nand all directions. I come to you\nlost, wholly trusting as a man who goes\ninto the forest unarmed. It is as though I descend\nslowly earthward out of the air. I rest in peace\nin you, when I arrive at last.\nOur bond is no little economy based on the exchange\nof my love and work for yours, so much for so much\nof an expendable fund. We don't know what its limits are--\nthat puts us in the dark. We are more together\nthan we know, how else could we keep on discovering\nwe are more together than we thought?\nYou are the known way leading always to the unknown,\nand you are the known place to which the unknown is always\nleading me back. More blessed in you than I know,\nI possess nothing worthy to give you, nothing\nnot belittled by my saying that I possess it.\nEven an hour of love is a moral predicament, a blessing\na man may be hard up to be worthy of. He can only\naccept it, as a plant accepts from all the bounty of the light\nenough to live, and then accepts the dark,\npassing unencumbered back to the earth, as I\nhave fallen time and again from the great strength\nVI.\nWhat I am learning to give you is my death\nto set you free of me, and me from myself\ninto the dark and the new light. Like the water\nof a deep stream, love is always too much. We\ndid not make it. Though we drink till we burst\nwe cannot have it all, or want it all.\nIn its abundance it survives our thirst.\nIn the evening we come down to the shore\nto drink our fill, and sleep, while it\nflows through the regions of the dark.\nIt does not hold us, except we keep returning\nto its rich waters thirsty. We enter,\nwilling to die, into the commonwealth of its joy.\nVII.\nI give you what is unbounded, passing from dark to dark,\ncontaining darkness: a night of rain, an early morning.\nI give you the life I have let live for the love of you:\na clump of orange-blooming weeds beside the road,\nthe young orchard waiting in the snow, our own life\nthat we have planted in the ground, as I\nhave planted mine in you. I give you my love for all\nbeautiful and honest women that you gather to yourself\nagain and again, and satisfy--and this poem,\nno more mine than any man's who has loved a woman.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/12625918-The-Country-of-Marriage-by-Wendell-Berry"}

Our hearts are still throbbing,\nThough, for each other, yet ah! 'gainst one another no more.\nOh, thou single moment, wherein I found life! thou outweighest\nEvery day which had else coldly from memory fled.\n'Twas in that moment alone, the last, that upon me descended\nLife, such as deities grant, though thou perceived'st it not.\nPhoebus, in vain with thy rays dost thou clothe the ether in glory:\nThine all-brightening day hateful alone is to me.\nInto myself I retreat for shelter, and there, in the silence,\nStrive to recover the time when she appear'd with each day.\nWas it possible beauty like this to see, and not feel it?\nWork'd not those heavenly charms e'en on a mind dull as thine?\nBlame not thyself, unhappy one! Oft doth the bard an enigma\nThus propose to the throng, skillfully hidden in words.\nEach one enjoys the strange commingling of images graceful,\nYet still is wanting the word which will discover the sense.\nWhen at length it is found, the heart of each hearer is gladden'd,\nAnd in the poem he sees meaning of twofold delight.\nWherefore so late didst thou remove the bandage, oh Amor,\nWhich thou hadst placed o'er mine eyes,--wherefore remove it so late?\nLong did the vessel, when laden, lie waiting for favouring breezes,\n'Till in kindness the wind blew from the land o'er the sea.\nVacant times of youth! and vacant dreams of the future!\nYe all vanish, and nought, saving the moment, remains.\nYes! it remains,--my joy still remains! I hold thee; my Dora,\nAnd thine image alone, Dora, by hope is disclos'd.\nOft have I seen thee go, with modesty clad, to the temple,\nWhile thy mother so dear solemnly went by thy side.\nEager\u00a0 and nimble thou wert, in bearing thy fruit to the market,\nBoldly the pail from the well didst thou sustain on thy head.\nThen was reveal'd thy neck, then seen thy shoulders so beauteous,\nThen, before all things, the grace filling thy motions was seen.\nOft have I fear'd that the pitcher perchance was in danger of falling,\nYet it ever remain'd firm on the circular cloth.\nThus, fair neighbour, yes, thus I oft was wont to observe thee,\nAs on the stars I might gaze, as I might gaze on the moon,\nGlad indeed at the sight, yet feeling within my calm bosom\nNot the remotest desire ever to call them mine own.\nYears thus fleeted away! Although our houses were only\nTwenty paces apart, yet I thy threshold ne'er cross'd.\nNow by the fearful flood are we parted! Thou liest to Heaven,\nBillow! thy beautiful blue seems to me dark as the night.\nAll were now in movement; a boy to the house of my father\nRan at full speed and exclaim'd: \"Hasten thee quick to the strand\nHoisted the sail is already, e'en now in the wind it is flutt'ring,\nWhile the anchor they weigh, heaving it up from the sand;\nCome, Alexis, oh come!\"--My worthy stout-hearted father\nPress'd, with a blessing, his hand down on my curly-lock'd head,\nWhile my mother carefully reach'd me a newly-made bundle,\n\"Happy mayst thou return!\" cried they--\" both happy and rich!\"\nThen I sprang away, and under my arm held the bundle,\nRunning along by the wall. Standing I found thee hard by,\nAt the door of thy garden. Thou smilingly saidst then \"Alexis!\nSay, are yon boisterous crew going thy comrades to be?\nForeign coasts will thou visit, and precious merchandise purchase,\nOrnaments meet for the rich matrons who dwell in the town.\nBring me, also, I praythee, a light chain; gladly I'll pay thee,\nOft have I wish'd to possess some stich a trinket as that.\"\nThere I remain'd, and ask'd, as merchants are wont, with precision\nAfter the form and the weight which thy commission should have.\nModest, indeed, was the price thou didst name! I meanwhile was gazing\nOn thy neck which deserv'd ornaments worn but by queens.\nLoudly now rose the cry from the ship; then kindly thou spakest\n\"Take, I entreat thee, some fruit out of the garden, my friend\nTake the ripest oranges, figs of the whitest; the ocean\nBeareth no fruit, and, in truth, 'tis not produced by each land.\"\nSo I entered in. Thou pluckedst the fruit from the branches,\nAnd the burden of gold was in thine apron upheld.\nOft did I cry, Enough! But fairer fruits were still falling\nInto the hand as I spake, ever obeying thy touch.\nPresently didst thou reached the arbour; there lay there a basket,\nSweet blooming myrtle trees wav'd, as we drew nigh, o'er our heads.\nThen thou began'st to arrange the fruit with skill and in silence:\nFirst the orange, which lay heavy as though 'twere of gold,\nThen the yielding fig, by the slightest pressure disfigur'd,\nAnd with myrtle the gift soon was both cover'd and grac'd.\nBut I raised it not up. I stood. Our eyes met together,\nAnd my eyesight grew dim, seeming obscured by a film,\nSoon I felt thy bosom on mine! Mine arm was soon twining\nRound thy beautiful form; thousand times kiss'd I thy neck.\nOn my shoulder sank thy head; thy fair arms, encircling,\nSoon rendered perfect the ring knitting the rapturous pair.\nAmor's hands I felt: he press'd us together with ardour,\nAnd, from the firmament clear, thrice did it thunder; then tears\nStream'd from mine eyes in torrents, thou weptest, I wept, both were weeping,\nAnd, 'mid our sorrow and bliss, even the world seem'd to die.\nLouder and louder they calI'd from the strand; my feet would no longer\nBear my weight, and I cried:--\"Dora! and art thou not mine?\"\n\"Thine forever!\" thou gently didst say. Then the tears we were shedding\nSeem'd to be wiped from our eyes, as by the breath of a god.\nNearer was heard the cry \"Alexis!\" The stripling who sought me\nSuddenly peep'd through the door. How he the basket snatch'd up!\nHow he urged me away! how press'd I thy hand! Wouldst thou ask me\nHow the vessel I reach'd? Drunken I seem'd, well I know.\nDrunken my shipmates believed me, and so had pity upon me;\nAnd as the breeze drove us on, distance the town soon obscur'd.\n\"Thine for ever!\" thou, Dora, didst murmur; it fell on my senses\nWith the thunder of Zeus! while by the thunderer's throne\nStood his daughter, the Goddess of Love; the Graces were standing\nClose by her side! so the bond beareth an impress divine!\nOh then hasten, thou ship, with every favouring zephyr!\nOnward, thou powerful keel, cleaving the waves as they foam!\nBring me unto the foreign harbour, so that the goldsmith\nMay in his workshop prepare straightway the heavenly pledge!\nAy, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!\nNine times encircling thy neck, loosely around it entwin'd\nOther and manifold trinkets I'll buy thee; gold-mounted bracelets,\nRichly and skillfully wrought, also shall grace thy fair hand.\nThere shall the ruby and emerald vie, the sapphire so lovely\nBe to the jacinth oppos'd, seeming its foil; while the gold\nHolds all the jewels together, in beauteous union commingled.\nOh, how the bridegroom exults, when he adorns his betroth'd!\nPearls if I see, of thee they remind me; each ring that is shown me\nBrings to my mind thy fair hand's graceful and tapering form.\nI will barter and buy; the fairest of all shalt thou choose thee,\nJoyously would I devote all of the cargo to thee.\nYet not trinkets and jewels alone is thy loved one procuring;\nWith them he brings thee whate'er gives to a housewife delight.\nFine and woollen coverlets, wrought with an edging of purple,\nFit for a couch where we both, lovingly, gently may rest;\nCostly pieces of linen. Thou sittest and sewest, and clothest\nMe, and thyself, and, perchance, even a third with it too.\nVisions of hope, deceive ye my heart! Ye kindly Immortals,\nSoften this fierce-raging flame, wildly pervading my breast!\nYet how I long to feel them again, those rapturous torments.\nWhen, in their stead, care draws nigh, coldly and fearfully calm.\nNeither the Furies' torch, nor the hounds of hell with their harking\nAwe the delinquent so much, down in the plains of despair,\nAs by the motionless spectre I'm awed, that shows me the fair one\nFar away: of a truth, open the garden-door stands!\nAnd another one cometh! For him the fruit, too, is falling,\nAnd for him, also, the fig strengthening honey doth yield!\nBlind, ye Immortals! efface visions like this from my mind!\nYes, she is but a maiden! And she who to one doth so quickly\nYield, to another ere long, doubtless, Will turn herself round.\nSmile not, Zeus, for this once, at an oath so cruelly broken!\nThunder more fearfully! Strike!--Stay--thy fierce lightnings withhold!\nHurl at me thy quivering bolt!

{"title": "Aspasia", "author": "Count Giacomo Leopardi", "text": "At times thy image to my mind returns,\nAspasia. In the crowded streets it gleams\nUpon me, for an instant, as I pass,\nIn other faces; or in lonely fields,\nAt noon-tide bright, beneath the silent stars,\nWith sudden and with startling vividness,\nAs if awakened by sweet harmony,\nThe splendid vision rises in my soul.\nHow worshipped once, ye gods, what a delight\nTo me, what torture, too! Nor do I e'er\nThe odor of the flowery fields inhale,\nOr perfume of the gardens of the town,\nThat I recall thee not, as on that day,\nWhen in thy sumptuous rooms, so redolent\nOf all the fragrant flowers of the spring,\nArrayed in robe of violet hue, thy form\nAngelic I beheld, as it reclined\nOn dainty cushions languidly, and by\nAn atmosphere voluptuous surrounded;\nWhen thou, a skilful Syren, didst imprint\nUpon thy children's round and rosy lips\nResounding, fervent kisses, stretching forth\nThy neck of snow, and with thy lovely hand,\nThe little, unsuspecting innocents\nDidst to thy hidden, tempting bosom press.\nThe earth, the heavens transfigured seemed to me,\nA ray divine to penetrate my soul.\nThen in my side, not unprotected quite,\nDeep driven by thy hand, the shaft I bore,\nLamenting sore; and not to be removed,\nTill twice the sun his annual round had made.\nA ray divine, O lady! to my thought\nThy beauty seemed. A like effect is oft\nBy beauty caused, and harmony, that seem\nThe mystery of Elysium to reveal.\nThe stricken mortal fondly worships, then,\nHis own ideal, creature of his mind,\nWhich of his heaven the greater part contains.\nAlike in looks, in manners, and in speech,\nThe real and ideal seem to him,\nIn his confused and passion-guided soul.\nBut not the woman, but the dream it is,\nThat in his fond caresses, he adores.\nAt last his error finding, and the sad exchange,\nHe is enraged, and most unjustly, oft,\nThe woman chides. For rarely does the mind\nOf woman to that high ideal rise;\nAnd that which her own beauty oft inspires\nIn generous lovers, she imagines not,\nNor could she comprehend. Those narrow brows,\nCannot such great conceptions hold. The man,\nDeceived, builds false hopes on those lustrous eyes,\nAnd feelings deep, ineffable, nay, more\nThan manly, vainly seeks in her, who is\nBy nature so inferior to man.\nFor as her limbs more soft and slender are,\nSo is her mind less capable and strong.\nNor hast thou ever known, Aspasia,\nOr couldst thou comprehend the thoughts that once\nThou didst inspire in me. Thou knowest not\nWhat boundless love, what sufferings intense,\nWhat ravings wild, what savage impulses,\nThou didst arouse in me; nor will the time\nE'er come when thou could'st understand them. So,\nMusicians, too, are often ignorant\nOf the effects they with the hand and voice\nProduce on him that listens. Dead is _that_\nAspasia, that I so loved, aye, dead\nForever, who was once sole object of\nMy life; save as a phantom, ever dear,\nThat comes from time to time, and disappears.\nThou livest still, not only beautiful,\nBut in thy beauty still surpassing all;\nBut oh, the flame thou didst enkindle once,\nLong since has been extinguished; _thee_, indeed,\nI never loved, but that Divinity,\nOnce living, buried now within my heart.\nHer, long time, I adored; and was so pleased\nWith her celestial beauty, that, although\nI from the first thy nature knew full well,\nAnd all thy artful and coquettish ways,\nYet _her_ fair eyes beholding still in _thine_,\nDeceived? Ah, no! But by the pleasure led,\nOf that sweet likeness, that allured me so,\nA long and heavy servitude to bear.\nNow boast; thou can'st! Say, that to thee alone\nOf all thy sex, my haughty head I bowed,\nTo thee alone, of my unconquered heart\nAn offering made. Say, that thou wast the first--\nAnd surely wast the last--that in my eye\nA suppliant look beheld, and me before\nThee stand, timid and trembling (how I blush,\nIn saying it, with anger and with shame),\nOf my own self deprived, thy every wish,\nThy every word submissively observing,\nAt every proud caprice becoming pale,\nAt every sign of favor brightening,\nAnd changing color at each look of thine.\nThe charm is over, and, with it, the yoke\nLies broken, scattered on the ground; and I\nRejoice. 'Tis true my days are laden with\nEnnui; yet after such long servitude,\nAnd such infatuation, I am glad\nMy judgment, freedom to resume. For though\nA life bereft of love's illusions sweet,\nIs like a starless night, in winter's midst,\nYet some revenge, some comfort can I find\nFor my hard fate, that here upon the grass,\nOutstretched in indolence I lie, and gaze\nUpon the earth and sea and sky, and smile.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8527609-Aspasia-by-Count-Giacomo-Leopardi"}

For ever in his soul the power\nOf great desire had been rebuked and crushed\nBy sovereign fear. So great a child and slave\nHad he become, through his excess of love!\nBut death at last the cruel silence broke;\nFor being by sure signs convinced, that now\nThe day of his deliverance had come,\nHer white hand taking, as she was about\nTo leave, and gently pressing it, he said:\n\"Thou goest; it is time for thee to go;\nFarewell, Elvira! I shall never see\nThee more; too well I know it; so, farewell!\nI thank thee for thy gentle sympathy,\nSo far as my poor lips my thanks can speak.\n_He_ will reward thee, who alone has power,\nIf heaven e'er rewards the merciful.\"\nPale turned the fair one at these words; a sigh\nHer bosom heaved; for e'en a stranger's heart\nA throb responsive feels, when she departs,\nAnd says farewell forever. Fain would she\nHave contradicted him, the near approach\nOf fate concealing from the dying man.\nBut he, her thought anticipating, said:\n\"Ah, much desired, as well thou knowest, death,\nMuch prayed for, and not dreaded, comes to me;\nNay, joyful seems to me this fatal day,\nSave for the thought of losing thee forever;\nAlas, forever do I part from thee!\nIn saying this my heart is rent in twain.\nThose eyes I shall no more behold, nor hear\nThy voice. But, O Elvira, say, before\nThou leavest me forever, wilt thou not\nOne kiss bestow? A single kiss, in all\nMy life? A favor asked, who can deny\nUnto a dying man? Of the sweet gift\nI ne'er can boast, so near my end, whose lips\nTo-day will by a stranger's hand be closed\nForever.\" Saying this, with a deep sigh,\nHer hand beloved he with his cold lips pressed.\nThe lovely woman stood irresolute,\nAnd thoughtful, for a moment, with her look,\nIn which a thousand charms were radiant,\nIntent on that of the unhappy man,\nWhere the last tear was glittering. Nor would\nHer heart permit her to refuse with scorn\nHis wish, and by refusal, make more sad\nThe sad farewell; but she compassion took\nUpon his love, which she had known so long;\nAnd that celestial face, that mouth, which he\nSo long had coveted, which had, for years,\nThe burden been of all his dreams and sighs,\nClose bringing unto his, so sad and wan,\nDiscolored by his mortal agony,\nKiss after kiss, all goodness, with a look\nOf deep compassion, on the trembling lips\nOf the enraptured lover she impressed.\nWhat didst thou then become? How in thy eyes\nAppeared life, death, and all thy suffering,\nConsalvo, in thy flight now pausing? He\nThe hand, which still he held, of his beloved\nElvira, placing on his heart, whose last\nPulsations love with death was sharing, said:\n\"Elvira, my Elvira, am I still\nOn earth? Those lips, were they thy lips? O, say!\nAnd do I press thy hand? Alas, it seems\nA dead man's vision, or a dream, or thing\nIncredible! How much, Elvira, O,\nHow much I owe to death! Long has my love\nBeen known to thee, and unto others, for\nTrue love cannot be hidden on the earth.\nToo manifest it was to thee, in looks,\nIn acts, in my unhappy countenance,\nBut never in my words. For then, and now,\nForever would the passion infinite,\nThat rules my heart, be silent, had not death\nWith courage filled it. I shall die content;\nHenceforth, with destiny, no more regret\nThat I e'er saw the light. I have not lived\nIn vain, now that my lips have been allowed\nThy lips to press. Nay, happy I esteem\nMy lot. Two precious things the world still gives\nTo mortals, Love and Death. To one, heaven guides\nMe now, in youth; and in the other, I\nAm fortunate. Ah, hadst thou once, but once,\nResponded to my long-enduring love,\nTo my changed eyes this earth for evermore\nHad been transformed into a Paradise.\nE'en to old age, detestable old age,\nCould I have been resigned and reconciled.\nTo bear its heavy load, the memory\nOf one transcendent moment had sufficed,\nWhen I was happier than the happiest,\nBut, ah, such bliss supreme the envious gods\nTo earthly natures ne'er have given! Love\nIn such excess ne'er leads to happiness.\nAnd yet, thy love to win, I would have borne\nThe tortures of the executioner;\nHave faced the rack and fagot, dauntlessly;\nWould from thy loving arms have rushed into\nThe fearful flames of hell, with cheerfulness.\n\"Elvira, O Elvira, happy he,\nBeyond all mortal happiness, on whom\nThou dost the smile of love bestow! And next\nIs he, who can lay down his life for thee!\nIt _is_ permitted, it is not a dream,\nAs I, alas, have always fancied it,\nTo man, on earth true happiness to find.\nI knew it well, the day I looked on thee.\nThat look to me, indeed, has fatal been:\nAnd yet, I could not bring myself, midst all\nMy sufferings, that cruel day to blame.\n\"Now live, Elvira, happy, and adorn\nThe world with thy fair countenance. None e'er\nWill love thee as I loved thee. Such a love\nWill ne'er be seen on earth. How much, alas,\nHow long a time by poor Consalvo hast\nThou been with sighs and bitter tears invoked!\nHow, when I heard thy name, have I turned pale!\nHow have I trembled, and been sick at heart,\nAs timidly thy threshold I approached,\nAt that angelic voice, at sight of that\nFair brow, I, who now tremble not at death!\nBut breath and life no longer will respond\nUnto the voice of love.

{"title": "First Love", "author": "Count Giacomo Leopardi", "text": "Ah, well can I the day recall, when first\nThe conflict fierce of love I felt, and said:\nIf _this_ be love, how hard it is to bear!\nWith eyes still fixed intent upon the ground,\nI saw but _her_, whose artless innocence,\nTriumphant took possession of this heart.\nAh, Love, how badly hast thou governed me!\nWhy should affection so sincere and pure,\nBring with it such desire, such suffering?\nWhy not serene, and full, and free from guile\nBut sorrow-laden, and lamenting sore,\nShould joy so great into my heart descend?\nO tell me, tender heart, that sufferest so,\nWhy with that thought such anguish should be blent,\nCompared with which, all other thoughts were naught?\nThat thought, that ever present in the day,\nThat in the night more vivid still appeared,\nWhen all things round in sweet sleep seemed to rest:\nThou, restless, both with joy and misery\nDidst with thy constant throbbings weary so\nMy breast, as panting in my bed I lay.\nAnd when worn out with grief and weariness,\nIn sleep my eyes I closed, ah, no relief\nIt gave, so broken and so feverish!\nHow brightly from the depths of darkness, then,\nThe lovely image rose, and my closed eyes,\nBeneath their lids, their gaze upon it fed!\nO what delicious impulses, diffused,\nMy weary frame with sweet emotion filled!\nWhat myriad thoughts, unstable and confused,\nWere floating in my mind! As through the leaves\nOf some old grove, the west wind, wandering,\nA long, mysterious murmur leaves behind.\nAnd as I, silent, to their influence yield,\nWhat saidst thou, heart, when she departed, who\nHad caused thee all thy throbs, and suffering?\nNo sooner had I felt within, the heat\nOf love's first flame, than with it flew away\nThe gentle breeze, that fanned it into life.\nSleepless I lay, until the dawn of day;\nThe steeds, that were to leave me desolate,\nTheir hoofs were beating at my father's gate.\nAnd I, in mute suspense, poor timid fool,\nWith eye that vainly would the darkness pierce,\nAnd eager ear intent, lay, listening,\nThat voice to hear, if, for the last time, I\nMight catch the accents from those lovely lips;\nThe voice alone; all else forever lost!\nHow many vulgar tones my doubtful ear\nWould smite, with deep disgust inspiring me,\nWith doubt tormented, holding hard my breath!\nAnd when, at last, that voice into my heart\nDescended, passing sweet, and when the sound\nOf horses and of wheels had died away;\nIn utter desolation, then, my head\nI in my pillow buried, closed my eyes,\nAnd pressed my hand against my heart, and sighed.\nThen, listlessly, my trembling knees across\nThe silent chamber dragging, I exclaimed,\n\"Nothing on earth can interest me more!\"\nThe bitter recollection cherishing\nWithin my breast, to every voice my heart,\nTo every face, insensible remained.\nLong I remained in hopeless sorrow drowned;\nAs when the heavens far and wide their showers\nIncessant pour upon the fields around.\nNor had I, Love, thy cruel power known,\nA boy of eighteen summers flown, until\nThat day, when I thy bitter lesson learned;\nWhen I each pleasure held in scorn, nor cared\nThe shining stars to see, or meadows green,\nOr felt the charm of holy morning light;\nThe love of glory, too, no longer found\nAn echo in my irresponsive breast,\nThat, once, the love of beauty with it shared.\nMy favorite studies I neglected quite;\nAnd those things vain appeared, compared with which,\nI used to think all other pleasures vain.\nAh! how could I have changed so utterly?\nHow could one passion all the rest destroy?\nMy heart my only comfort was, and with\nThat heart, in conference perpetual,\nA constant watch upon my grief to keep.\nMy eye still sought the ground, or in itself\nAbsorbed, shrank from encountering the glance\nOf lovely or unlovely countenance;\nThe stainless image fearing to disturb,\nSo faithfully reflected in my breast;\nAs winds disturb the mirror of the lake.\nAnd that regret, that I could not enjoy\nSuch happiness, which weighs upon the mind,\nAnd turns to poison pleasure that has passed,\nDid still its thorn within my bosom lodge,\nAs I the past recalled; but shame, indeed,\nLeft not its cruel sting within this heart.\nTo heaven, to you, ye gentle souls, I swear,\nNo base desire intruded on my thought;\nBut with a pure and sacred flame I burned.\nThat flame still lives, and that affection pure;\nStill in my thought that lovely image breathes,\nFrom which, save heavenly, I no other joy,\nHave ever known; my only comfort, now!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8527613-First-Love-by-Count-Giacomo-Leopardi"}

And, even as she turned,\nThe lightning ceased to flash, the air was dark,\nThe thunder's voice was hushed, the wind stood still,\nAnd all was silent round, and she,--at rest!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Fragment--II"}

If ancient legends speak\nOf sins of yours, that brought calamity\nUpon the human race, and fell disease,\nAlas, the sins more terrible, by far,\nCommitted by your children, and their souls\nMore restless, and with mad ambition fixed,\nAgainst them roused the wrath of angry gods,\nThe hand of all-sustaining Nature armed,\nBy them so long neglected and despised.\nThen life became a burden and a curse,\nAnd every new-born babe a thing abhorred,\nAnd hell and chaos reigned upon the earth.\nThou first the day, and thou the shining lights\nOf the revolving stars didst see, the fields,\nAnd their new flocks and herds, O leader old\nAnd father of the human family!\nThe wandering air that o'er the meadows played,\nWhen smote the rocks, and the deserted vales,\nThe torrent, rustling headlong from the Alps,\nWith sound, till then, unheard; and o'er the sites\nOf future nations, noisy cities, yet unknown\nTo fame, a peace profound, mysterious reigned;\nAnd o'er the unploughed hills, in silence, rose\nThe ray of Phoebus, and the golden moon.\nO world, how happy in thy loneliness,\nOf crimes and of disasters ignorant!\nFor thy poor race, unhappy father, what\nA series vast of terrible events!\nBehold, the fields, scarce tilled, with blood are stained,\nA brother's blood, in sudden frenzy shed;\nAnd now, alas, first hears the gentle air\nThe whirring of the fearful wings of Death.\nThe trembling fratricide, a fugitive,\nThe lonely shades avoids; in every blast\nThat sweeps the groves, a voice of wrath he hears.\n_He_ the first city builds, abode and realm\nOf wasting cares; repentance desperate,\nHeart-sick, and groaning, thus unites and binds\nTogether blind and sinful souls, and first\nA refuge offers unto mutual guilt.\nThe wicked hand now scorns the crooked plough;\nThe sweat of honest labor is despised;\nNow sloth possession of the threshold takes;\nThe sluggish frames their native vigor lose;\nThe minds in hopeless indolence are sunk;\nAnd slavery, the crowning curse of all,\nDegrades and crushes poor humanity.\nAnd thou from heaven's wrath, and ocean's waves,\nThat bellowed round the cloud-capped mountain-tops,\nThe sinful brood didst save; thou, unto whom,\nFrom the dark air and wave-encumbered hills,\nThe white dove brought the sign of hope renewed,\nAnd sinking in the west, the shipwrecked sun,\nHis bright rays darting through the angry clouds,\nThe dark sky painted with the lovely bow.\nThe same career of wickedness and lust,\nWith their attendant ills. Audacious man\nDefies the threats of the avenging sea,\nAnd to new shores and to new stars repeats\nThe same sad tale of infamy and woe.\nAnd now of thee I think, the just and brave,\nThe Father of the faithful, and the sons\nThy honored name that bore. Of thee I speak,\nWhom, sitting, thoughtful, in the noontide shade,\nBefore thy humble cottage, near the banks,\nThat gave thy flocks both rest and nourishment,\nThe minds ethereal of celestial guests\nWith blessings greeted; and of thee, O son\nOf wise Rebecca, how at eventide,\nIn Aran's valley sweet, and by the well,\nWhere happy swains in friendly converse met,\nThou didst with Laban's daughter fall in love;\nLove, that to exile long, and suffering,\nAnd to the odious yoke of servitude,\nThy patient soul a willing martyr led.\nOh, surely once,--for not with idle tales\nAnd shadows, the Aonian song, and voice\nOf Fame, the eager list'ners feed,--once was\nThis wretched earth more friendly to our race,\nWas more beloved and dear, and golden flew\nThe days, that now so laden are with care.\nNot that the milk, in waves of purest white,\nGushed from the rocks, and flowed along the vales;\nOr that the tigers mingled with the sheep,\nTo the same fold were led; or shepherd-boys\nWith playful wolves would frolic at the spring;\nBut of its own lot ignorant, and all\nOf care it lived: a soft, illusive veil\nOf error hid the stern realities,\nThe cruel laws of heaven and of fate.\nLife glided on, with cheerful hope content;\nAnd tranquil, sought the haven of its rest.\nSo lives, in California's forests vast,\nA happy race, whose life-blood is not drained\nBy pallid care, whose limbs are not by fierce\nDisease consumed: the woods their food, their homes\nThe hollow rock, the streamlet of the vale\nIts waters furnishes, and, unforeseen,\nDark death upon them steals. Ah, how unarmed,\nWise Nature's happy votaries, are ye,\nAgainst our impious audacity!\nOur fierce, indomitable love of gain\nYour shores, your caves, your quiet woods invades;\nYour minds corrupts, your bodies enervates;\nAnd happiness, a naked fugitive,\nBefore it drives, to earth's remotest bounds.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Hymn-To-The-Patriarchs"}

{"title": "Palinodia", "author": "Count Giacomo Leopardi", "text": "TO THE MARQUIS GINO CAPPONI.\nI was mistaken, my dear Gino. Long\nAnd greatly have I erred. I fancied life\nA vain and wretched thing, and this, our age,\nNow passing, vainest, silliest of all.\nIntolerable seemed, and _was_, such talk\nUnto the happy race of mortals, if,\nIndeed, man ought or could be mortal called.\n'Twixt anger and surprise, the lofty creatures laughed\nForth from the fragrant Eden where they dwell;\nNeglected, or unfortunate, they called me;\nOf joy incapable, or ignorant,\nTo think my lot the common lot of all,\nMankind, the partner in my misery.\nAt length, amid the odor of cigars,\nThe crackling sound of dainty pastry, and\nThe orders loud for ices and for drinks,\n'Midst clinking glasses, and 'midst brandished spoons,\nThe daily light of the gazettes flashed full\nOn my dim eyes. I saw and recognized\nThe public joy, and the felicity\nOf human destiny. The lofty state\nI saw, and value of all human things;\nOur mortal pathway strewed with flowers; I saw\nHow naught displeasing here below endures.\nNor less I saw the studies and the works\nStupendous, wisdom, virtue, knowledge deep\nOf this our age. From far Morocco to\nCathay, and from the Poles unto the Nile,\nFrom Boston unto Goa, on the track\nOf flying Fortune, emulously panting,\nThe empires, kingdoms, dukedoms of the earth\nI saw, now clinging to her waving locks,\nNow to the end of her encircling boa.\nBeholding this, and o'er the ample sheets\nProfoundly meditating, I became\nOf my sad blunder, and myself, ashamed.\nThe age of gold the spindles of the Fates,\nO Gino, are evolving. Every sheet,\nIn each variety of speech and type,\nThe splendid promise to the world proclaims,\nFrom every quarter. Universal love,\nAnd iron roads, and commerce manifold,\nSteam, types, and cholera, remotest lands,\nMost distant nations will together bind;\nNor need we wonder if the pine or oak\nYield milk and honey, or together dance\nUnto the music of the waltz. So much\nThe force already hath increased, both of\nAlembics, and retorts, and of machines,\nThat vie with heaven in working miracles,\nAnd will increase, in times that are to come:\nFor, evermore, from better unto best,\nWithout a pause, as in the past, the race\nOf Shem, and Ham, and Japhet will progress.\nAnd yet, on acorns men will never feed,\nUnless compelled by hunger; never will\nHard iron lay aside. Full oft, indeed,\nThey gold and silver will despise, bills of\nExchange preferring. Often, too, the race\nIts generous hands with brothers' blood will stain,\nWith fields of carnage filling Europe, and\nThe other shore of the Atlantic sea,\nThe new world, that the old still nourishes,\nAs often as it sends its rival bands\nOf armed adventurers, in eager quest\nOf pepper, cinnamon, or other spice,\nOr sugar-cane, aught that ministers\nUnto the universal thirst for gold.\nTrue worth and virtue, modesty and faith,\nAnd love of justice, in whatever land,\nFrom public business will be still estranged,\nOr utterly humiliated and\nO'erthrown; condemned by Nature still,\nTo sink unto the bottom. Insolence\nAnd fraud, with mediocrity combined,\nWill to the surface ever rise, and reign.\nAuthority and strength, howe'er diffused,\nHowever concentrated, will be still\nAbused, beneath whatever name concealed,\nBy him who wields them; this the law by Fate\nAnd nature written first, in adamant:\nNor can a Volta with his lightnings, nor\nA Davy cancel it, nor England with\nHer vast machinery, nor this our age\nWith all its floods of Leading Articles.\nThe good man ever will be sad, the wretch\nWill keep perpetual holiday; against\nAll lofty souls both worlds will still be armed\nConspirators; true honor be assailed\nBy calumny, and hate, and envy; still\nThe weak will be the victim of the strong;\nThe hungry man upon the rich will fawn,\nBeneath whatever form of government,\nAlike at the Equator and the Poles;\nSo will it be, while man on earth abides,\nAnd while the sun still lights him on his way.\nThese signs and tokens of the ages past\nMust of necessity their impress leave\nUpon our brightly dawning age of gold:\nBecause society from Nature still\nReceives a thousand principles and aims,\nDiverse, discordant; which to reconcile,\nNo wit or power of man hath yet availed,\nSince first our race, illustrious, was born;\nNor _will_ avail, or treaty or gazette,\nIn any age, however wise or strong.\nBut in things more important, how complete,\nNe'er seen, till now, will be our happiness!\nMore soft, from day to day, our garments will\nBecome, of woollen or of silk. Their rough\nAttire the husbandman and smith will cast\nAside, will swathe in cotton their rough hides,\nAnd with the skins of beavers warm their backs.\nMore serviceable, more attractive, too,\nWill be our carpets and our counterpanes,\nOur curtains, sofas, tables, and our chairs;\nOur beds, and their attendant furniture,\nWill a new grace unto our chambers lend;\nAnd dainty forms of kettles and of pans,\nOn our dark kitchens will their lustre shed.\nFrom Paris unto Calais, and from there\nTo London, and from there to Liverpool,\nMore rapid than imagination can\nConceive, will be the journey, nay the flight;\nWhile underneath the ample bed of Thames,\nA highway will be made, immortal work,\nThat _should_ have been completed, years ago.\nFar better lighted, and perhaps as safe,\nAt night, as now they are, will be the lanes\nAnd unfrequented streets of Capitals;\nPerhaps, the main streets of the smaller towns.\nSuch privileges, such a happy lot,\nKind heaven reserves unto the coming race.\nNaked and whimpering, in her arms receives\nThe midwife! They those longed-for days may hope\nTo see, when, after careful studies we\nShall know, and every nursling shall imbibe\nThat knowledge with the milk of the dear nurse,\nHow many hundred-weight of salt, and how\nMuch flesh, how many bushels, too, of flour,\nHis native town in every month consumes;\nHow many births and deaths in every year\nThe parish priest inscribes: when by the aid\nOf mighty steam, that, every second, prints\nIts millions, hill and dale, and ocean's vast\nExpanse, e'en as we see a flock of cranes\nA\u00ebrial, that suddenly the day obscure, will with Gazettes be overrun;\nGazettes, of the great Universe the life\nAnd soul, sole fount of wisdom and of wit,\nTo this, and unto every coming age!\nE'en as a child, who carefully constructs,\nOf little sticks and leaves, an edifice,\nIn form of temple, palace, or of tower;\nAnd, soon as he beholds the work complete,\nThe impulse feels, the structure to destroy,\nBecause the self-same sticks and leaves he needs,\nTo carry out some other enterprise;\nSo Nature every work of hers, however\nIt may delight us with its excellence,\nNo sooner sees unto perfection brought,\nThan she proceeds to pull it all to pieces,\nFor other structures using still the parts.\nAnd vainly seeks the human race, itself\nOr others from the cruel sport to save,\nThe cause of which is hidden from its sight\nForever, though a thousand means it tries,\nWith skilful hand devising remedies:\nFor cruel Nature, child invincible,\nOur efforts laughs to scorn, and still its own\nCaprices carries out, without a pause,\nDestroying and creating, for its sport.\nAnd hence, a various, endless family\nOf ills incurable and sufferings\nOppresses the frail mortal, doomed to death\nIrreparably; hence a hostile force,\nDestructive, smites him from within, without,\nOn every side, perpetual, e'en from\nThe day of birth, and wearies and exhausts,\nItself untiring, till he drops at last,\nBy the inhuman mother crushed, and killed.\nThose crowning miseries, O gentle friend,\nOf this our mortal life, old age and death,\nE'en then commencing, when the infant lip\nThe tender breast doth press, that life instils,\nThis happy nineteenth century, I think,\nNor will the coming ages, more than this.\nIndeed, if we may be allowed to call\nThe truth by its right name, no other than\nSupremely wretched must each mortal be,\nIn every age, and under every form\nOf government, and walk and mode of life;\nBy nature hopelessly incurable,\nBecause a universal law hath so\nDecreed, which heaven and earth alike obey.\nAnd yet the lofty spirits of our age\nA new discovery have made, almost\nDivine; for, though they cannot make\nA single person happy on the earth,\nThe man forgetting, they have gone in quest\nOf universal happiness, and this,\nForsooth, have found so easily, that out\nOf many wretched individuals,\nThey can a happy, joyful people make.\nAnd at this miracle, not yet explained\nBy quarterly reviews, or pamphlets, or\nGazettes, the common herd in wonder smile.\nO minds, O wisdom, insight marvellous\nOf this our passing age! And what profound\nPhilosophy, what lessons deep, O Gino,\nIn matters more sublime and recondite,\nThis century of thine and mine will teach\nWhat yesterday it scorned, upon its knees\nTo-day it worships, and will overthrow\nTo-morrow, merely to pick up again\nHow estimable, how inspiring, too,\nThis unanimity of thought, not of\nThe age alone, but of each passing year!\nHow carefully should we, when we our thought\nWith this compare, however different\nFrom that of next year it may be, at least\nAppearance of diversity avoid!\nWhat giant strides, compared with those of old,\nOur century in wisdom's school has made!\nOne of thy friends, O worthy Gino, once,\nA master poet, nay, of every Art,\nAnd Science, every human faculty,\nFor past, and present, and for future times,\nA learned expositor, remarked to me:\n\"Of thy own feelings, care to speak no more!\nOf them, this manly age makes no account,\nIn economic problems quite absorbed,\nAnd with an eye for politics alone,\nOf what avail, thy own heart to explore?\nSeek not within thyself material\nFor song; but sing the needs of this our age,\nAnd consummation of its ripening hope!\"\nO memorable words! Whereat I laughed\nLike chanticleer, the name of _hope_ to hear\nThus strike upon my ear profane, as if\nA jest it were, or prattle of a child\nJust weaned.

And I who long to reach\nThe stars will not, howe'er, select the needs\nOf this our age for burden of my song;\nFor these, increasing constantly, are still\nBy merchants and by work-shops amply met;\nBut I will sing of hope, of hope whereof\nThe gods now grant a pledge so palpable.\nThe first-fruits of our new felicity\nBehold, in the enormous growth of hair,\nUpon the lip, upon the cheek, of youth!\nO hail, thou salutary sign, first beam\nOf light of this our wondrous, rising age!\nSee, how before thee heaven and earth rejoice,\nHow sparkle all the damsels' eyes with joy,\nHow through all banquets and all festivals\nThe fame of the young bearded heroes flies!\nGrow for your country's sake, ye manly youth!\nBeneath the shadow of your fleecy locks,\nWill Italy increase, and Europe from\nThe mouths of Tagus to the Hellespont,\nAnd all the world will taste the sweets of peace.\nAnd thou, O tender child, for whom these days\nThy bearded father with a smile, nor fear\nThe harmless blackness of his loving face.\nLaugh, darling child; for thee are kept the fruits\nOf so much dazzling eloquence.

Yet,\nAlas! as often as I dwell on you,\nYe ancient hopes, and youthful fancy's dreams,\nAnd then look at the blank reality,\nA life of ennui and of wretchedness;\nAnd think, that of so vast a fund of hope,\nDeath is, to-day, the only relic left,\nI feel oppressed at heart, I feel myself\nOf every comfort utterly bereft.\nAnd when the death, that I have long invoked,\nShall be at hand, the end be reached of all\nMy sufferings; when this vale of tears shall be\nTo me a stranger, and the future fade,\nFade from sight forever; even then, shall I\nRecall you; and your images will make\nMe sigh; the thought of having lived in vain,\nWill then intrude, with bitterness to taint\nThe sweetness of that day of destiny.\nNay, in the first tumultuous days of youth,\nWith all its joys, desires, and sufferings,\nI often called on death, and long would sit\nBy yonder fountain, longing, in its waves\nTo put an end alike to hope and grief.\nAnd afterwards, by lingering sickness brought\nUnto the borders of the grave, I wept\nO'er my lost youth, the flower of my days,\nSo prematurely fading; often, too,\nAt late hours sitting on my conscious bed,\nComposing, by the dim light of the lamp,\nI with the silence and the night would moan\nO'er my departing soul, and to myself\nIn languid tones would sing my funeral-song.\nWho can remember you without a sigh,\nFirst entrance into manhood, O ye days\nBewitching, inexpressible, when first\nOn the enchanted mortal smiles the maid,\nAnd all things round in emulation smile;\nAnd envy holds its peace, not yet awake,\nOr else in a benignant mood; and when,\nTo him extends, his faults excuses, greets\nHis entrance into life, with bows and smiles\nAcknowledges his claims to its respect?\nO fleeting days! How like the lightning's flash,\nThey vanish! And what mortal can escape\nUnhappiness, who has already passed\nThat golden period, his own _good_ time,\nThat comes, alas, so soon to disappear?\nAnd thou, Nerina, does not every spot\nThy memory recall? And couldst thou e'er\nBe absent from my thought? Where art thou gone,\nThat here I find the memory alone,\nOf thee, my sweet one? Thee thy native place\nBeholds no more; that window, whence thou oft\nWouldst talk with me, which sadly now reflects\nThe light of yonder stars, is desolate.\nWhere art thou, that I can no longer hear\nThy gentle voice, as in those days of old,\nWhen every faintest accent from thy lips\nWas wont to turn me pale? Those days have gone.\nThey _have been_, my sweet love! And thou with them\nHast passed. To others now it is assigned\nTo journey to and fro upon the earth,\nAnd others dwell amid these fragrant hills.\nHow quickly thou hast passed! Thy life was like\nA dream. While dancing there, joy on thy brow\nResplendent shone, anticipations bright\nShone in thy eyes, the light of youth, when Fate\nExtinguished them, and thou didst prostrate lie.\nNerina, in my heart the old love reigns.\nIf I at times still go unto some feast,\nOr social gathering, unto myself\nI say: \"Nerina, thou no more to feast\nDost go, nor for the ball thyself adorn.\"\nIf May returns, when lovers offerings\nOf flowers and of songs to maidens bring,\nI say: \"Nerina mine, to thee spring ne'er\nReturns, and love no more its tribute brings.\"\nEach pleasant day, each flowery field that I\nBehold, each pleasure that I taste, the thought\nSuggest: \"Nerina pleasure knows no more,\nThe face of heaven and earth no more beholds.\"\nAh, thou hast passed, for whom I ever sigh!\nHast passed; and still the memory of thee\nRemains, and with each thought and fancy blends\nEach varying emotion of the heart;\nAnd _will_ remain, so bitter, yet so sweet!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/Recollections"}

Oh how, how I\nHave grieved, still grieve for thee! Nor did I think\nThou e'er couldst know it more; and oh, that thought\nMy sorrow rendered more disconsolate!\nBut art thou now again to leave me?\nI fear so. Say, what hath befallen thee?\nArt thou the same? What preys upon thee thus?\"\n\"Oblivion weighs upon thy thoughts, and sleep\nEnvelops them,\" she answered; \"I am dead,\nAnd many months have passed, since last we met.\"\nWhat grief oppressed me, as these words I heard!\nAnd she continued: \"In the flower of youth\nCut off, when life is sweetest, and before\nThe heart that lesson sad and sure hath learnt,\nThe utter vanity of human hope!\nThe sick man may e'en covet, as a boon,\nThat which withdraws him from all suffering;\nBut to the young, Death comes, disconsolate;\nAnd hard the fate of hope, that in the grave\nIs quenched! And yet, how vain that knowledge is,\nThat Nature from the inexperienced hides!\nAnd a blind sorrow is to be preferred\nTo wisdom premature!\"--\"Hush, hush!\" I cried,\n\"Unhappy one, and dear! My heart is crushed\nWith these thy words! And art thou dead, indeed,\nO my beloved? and am I still alive?\nAnd was it, then, in heaven decreed, that this,\nThy tender body the last damps of death\nShould feel, and my poor, wretched frame remain\nUnharmed? Oh, often, often as I think\nThat thou no longer livest, and that I\nShall never see thee on the earth again,\nIncredible it seems! Alas, alas!\nWhat _is_ this thing, that they call death? Oh, would\nThat I, this day, the mystery could solve,\nAnd my defenceless head withdraw from Fate's\nRelentless hate! I still am young, and still\nFeel all the blight and misery of age,\nWhich I so dread; and distant far it seems;\nBut, ah, how little different from age,\nThe flower of my years!\"--\"We both were born,\"\nShe said, \"to weep; unhappy were our lives,\nAnd heaven took pleasure in our sufferings.\"\n\"Oh if my eyes with tears,\" I added, \"then,\nMy face with pallor veiled thou seest, for loss\nOf thee, and anguish weighing on my heart;\nTell me, was any spark of pity or of love\nFor the poor lover kindled in thy heart,\nWhile thou didst live? I, then, between my hope\nAnd my despair, passed weary nights and days;\nAnd now, my mind is with vain doubts oppressed.\nOh if but once compassion smote thee for\nMy darkened life, conceal it not from me,\nI pray thee; let the memory console me,\nSince of their future our young days were robbed!\"\nAnd she: \"Be comforted, unhappy one!\nI was not churlish of my pity whilst\nI lived, and am not now, myself so wretched!\nOh, do not chide this most unhappy child!\"\n\"By all our sufferings, and by the love\nWhich preys upon me,\" I exclaimed, \"and by\nOur youth, and by the hope that faded from\nOur lives, O let me, dearest, touch thy hand!\"\nAnd sweetly, sadly, she extended it.\nAnd while I covered it with kisses, while\nWith sorrow and with rapture quivering,\nI to my panting bosom fondly pressed it,\nWith fervent passion glowed my face and breast,\nMy trembling voice refused its utterance,\nAnd all things swam before my sight; when she,\nHer eyes fixed tenderly on mine, replied:\n\"And dost thou, then, forget, dear friend, that I\nAm of my beauty utterly deprived?\nAnd vainly thou, unhappy one, dost yield\nTo passion's transports. Now, a last farewell!\nOur wretched minds, our feeble bodies, too,\nEternally are parted. Thou to me\nNo longer livest, nevermore shall live.\nFate hath annulled the faith that thou hast sworn.\"\nThen, in my anguish as I seemed to cry\nAloud, convulsed, my eyes o'erflowing with\nI started from my sleep.

Thy graceful stems\nI in the solitary paths have found,\nThe city that surround,\nThat once was mistress of the world;\nAnd of her fallen power,\nThey seemed with silent eloquence to speak\nUnto the thoughtful wanderer.\nAnd now again I see thee on this soil,\nOf wretched, world-abandoned spots the friend,\nOf ruined fortunes the companion, still.\nThese fields with barren ashes strown,\nAnd lava, hardened into stone,\nBeneath the pilgrim's feet, that hollow sound,\nWhere by their nests the serpents coiled,\nLie basking in the sun,\nAnd where the conies timidly\nTo their familiar burrows run,\nWere cheerful villages and towns,\nWith waving fields of golden grain,\nAnd musical with lowing herds;\nWere gardens, and were palaces,\nThat to the leisure of the rich\nA grateful shelter gave;\nWere famous cities, which the mountain fierce,\nForth-darting torrents from his mouth of flame,\nDestroyed, with their inhabitants.\nNow all around, one ruin lies,\nWhere thou dost dwell, O gentle flower,\nAnd, as in pity of another's woe,\nA perfume sweet thou dost exhale,\nTo heaven an offering,\nAnd consolation to the desert bring.\nHere let him come, who hath been used\nTo chant the praises of our mortal state,\nAnd see the care,\nThat loving Nature of her children takes!\nHere may he justly estimate\nThe power of mortals, whom\nThe cruel nurse, when least they fear,\nWith motion light can in a moment crush\nIn part, and afterwards, when in the mood,\nWith motion not so light, can suddenly,\nAnd utterly annihilate.\nHere, on these blighted coasts,\nMay he distinctly trace\n\"The princely progress of the human race!\"\nHere look, and in a mirror see thyself,\nO proud and foolish age!\nThat turn'st thy back upon the path,\nThat thought revived\nSo clearly indicates to all,\nAnd this, thy movement retrograde,\nDost _Progress_ call.\nThy foolish prattle all the minds,\nWhose cruel fate thee for a father gave,\nBesmear with flattery,\nAlthough, among themselves, at times,\nThey laugh at thee.\nBut I will not to such low arts descend,\nThough envy it would be for me,\nThe rest to imitate,\nAnd, raving, wilfully,\nTo make my song more pleasing to thy ears:\nBut I will sooner far reveal,\nAs clearly as I can, the deep disdain\nThat I for thee within my bosom feel;\nAlthough I know, oblivion\nAwaits the man who holds his age in scorn:\nBut this misfortune, which I share with thee,\nMy laughter only moves.\nThou dream'st of liberty,\nAnd yet thou wouldst anew that thought enslave,\nBy which alone we are redeemed, in part,\nFrom barbarism; by which alone\nTrue progress is obtained,\nAnd states are guided to a nobler end.\nAnd so the truth of our hard lot,\nAnd of the humble place\nWhich Nature gave us, pleased thee not;\nAnd like a coward, thou hast turned thy back\nUpon the light, which made it evident;\nReviling him who does that light pursue,\nAnd praising him alone\nWho, in his folly, or from motives base,\nAbove the stars exalts the human race.\nA man of poor estate, and weak of limb,\nBut of a generous, truthful soul,\nNor calls, nor deems himself\nA Croesus, or a Hercules,\nNor makes himself ridiculous\nBefore the world with vain pretence\nOf vigor or of opulence;\nBut his infirmities and needs\nHe lets appear, and without shame,\nAnd speaking frankly, calls each thing\nBy its right name.\nI deem not _him_ magnanimous,\nBut simply, a great fool,\nWho, born to perish, reared in suffering,\nProclaims his lot a happy one,\nAnd with offensive pride\nHis pages fills, exalted destinies\nAnd joys, unknown in heaven, much less\nOn earth, absurdly promising to those\nWho by a wave of angry sea,\nOr breath of tainted air,\nOr shaking of the earth beneath,\nAre ruined, crushed so utterly,\nAs scarce to be recalled by memory.\nBut truly noble, wise is _he_,\nWho bids his brethren boldly look\nUpon our common misery;\nWho frankly tells the naked truth,\nAcknowledging our frail and wretched state,\nAnd all the ills decreed to us by Fate;\nWho shows himself in suffering brave and strong,\nNor adds unto his miseries\nFraternal jealousies and strifes,\nThe hardest things to bear of all,\nReproaching man with his own grief,\nBut the true culprit\nWho, in our birth, a mother is,\nA fierce step-mother in her will.\n_Her_ he proclaims the enemy,\nAnd thinking all the human race\nAgainst her armed, as is the case,\nE'en from the first, united and arrayed,\nAll men esteems confederates,\nAnd with true love embraces all,\nPrompt and efficient aid bestowing, and\nExpecting it, in all the pains\nAnd perils of the common war.\nAnd to resent with arms all injuries,\nOr snares and pit-falls for a neighbor lay,\nAbsurd he deems, as it would be, upon\nThe field, surrounded by the enemy,\nThe foe forgetting, bitter war\nWith one's own friends to wage,\nAnd in the hottest of the fight,\nWith cruel and misguided sword,\nOne's fellow soldiers put to flight.\nWhen truths like these are rendered clear,\nAs once they were, unto the multitude,\nAnd when that fear, which from the first,\nAll mortals in a social band\nAgainst inhuman Nature joined\nAnew shall guided be, in part,\nBy knowledge true, then social intercourse,\nAnd faith, and hope, and charity\nWill a far different foundation have\nFrom that which silly fables give,\nBy which supported, public truth and good\nMust still proceed with an unstable foot,\nAs all things that in error have their root.\nOft, on these hills, so desolate,\nWhich by the hardened flood,\nThat seems in waves to rise,\nAre clad in mourning, do I sit at night,\nAnd o'er the dreary plain behold\nThe stars above in purest azure shine,\nAnd in the ocean mirrored from afar,\nAnd all the world in brilliant sparks arrayed,\nRevolving through the vault serene.\nAnd when my eyes I fasten on those lights,\nWhich seem to them a point,\nAnd yet are so immense,\nThat earth and sea, with them compared,\nAre but a point indeed;\nTo whom, not only man,\nBut this our globe, where man is nothing, is\nUnknown; and when I farther gaze upon\nThose clustered stars, at distance infinite,\nThat seem to us like mist, to whom\nNot only man and earth, but all our stars\nAt once, so vast in numbers and in bulk,\nThe golden sun himself included, are\nUnknown, or else appear, as they to earth,\nA point of nebulous light, what, then,\nDost _thou_ unto my thought appear,\nO race of men?\nRemembering thy wretched state below,\nOf which the soil I tread, the token bears;\nAnd, on the other hand,\nThat thou thyself hast deemed\nThe Lord and end of all the Universe;\nHow oft thou hast been pleased\nThe idle tale to tell,\nThat to this little grain of sand, obscure,\nThe name of earth that bears,\nThe Authors of that Universe\nHave, at thy call, descended oft,\nAnd pleasant converse with thy children had;\nAnd how, these foolish dreams reviving, e'en\nThis age its insults heaps upon the wise,\nAlthough it seems all others to excel\nIn learning, and in arts polite;\nWhat can I think of thee\nThou wretched race of men?\nWhat thoughts discordant then my heart assail,\nIn doubt, if scorn or pity should prevail!\nAs a small apple, falling from a tree\nIn autumn, by the force\nOf its own ripeness, to the ground,\nThe pleasant homes of a community\nOf ants, in the soft clod\nWith careful labor built,\nAnd all their works, and all the wealth,\nWhich the industrious citizens\nLays waste, destroys, and in an instant hides;\nSo, falling from on high,\nTo heaven forth-darted from\nThe mountain's groaning womb,\nA dark destructive mass\nOf ashes, pumice, and of stones,\nWith boiling streams of lava mixed,\nOr, down the mountain's side\nDescending, furious, o'er the grass,\nA fearful flood\nOf melted metals, mixed with burning sand,\nLaid waste, destroyed, and in short time concealed\nThe cities on yon shore, washed by the sea,\nWhere now the goats\nOn this side browse, and cities new\nUpon the other stand, whose foot-stools are\nThe buried ones, whose prostrate walls\nThe lofty mountain tramples under foot.\nNature no more esteems or cares for man,\nThan for the ant; and if the race\nIs not so oft destroyed,\nThe reason we may plainly see;\nBecause the ants more fruitful are than we.\nFull eighteen hundred years have passed,\nSince, by the force of fire laid waste,\nThese thriving cities disappeared;\nAnd now, the husbandman,\nHis vineyards tending, that the arid clod,\nWith ashes clogged, with difficulty feeds,\nStill raises a suspicious eye\nUnto that fatal crest,\nThat, with a fierceness not to be controlled,\nStill stands tremendous, threatens still\nDestruction to himself, his children, and\nTheir little property.\nAnd oft upon the roof\nOf his small cottage, the poor man\nAll night lies sleepless, often springing up,\nThe course to watch of the dread stream of fire\nThat from the inexhausted womb doth pour\nAlong the sandy ridge,\nIts lurid light reflected in the bay,\nFrom Mergellina unto Capri's shore.\nAnd if he sees it drawing near,\nOr in his well\nHe hears the boiling water gurgle, wakes\nHis sons, in haste his wife awakes,\nAnd, with such things as they can snatch,\nEscaping, sees from far\nHis little nest, and the small field,\nHis sole resource against sharp hunger's pangs,\nA prey unto the burning flood,\nThat crackling comes, and with its hardening crust,\nInexorable, covers all.\nUnto the light of day returns,\nAfter its long oblivion,\nPompeii, dead, an unearthed skeleton,\nWhich avarice or piety\nAnd from its forum desolate,\nAnd through the formal rows\nOf mutilated colonnades,\nThe stranger looks upon the distant, severed peaks,\nAnd on the smoking crest,\nThat threatens still the ruins scattered round.\nAnd in the horror of the secret night,\nAlong the empty theatres,\nThe broken temples, shattered houses, where\nThe bat her young conceals,\nLike flitting torch, that smoking sheds\nA gloom through the deserted halls\nOf palaces, the baleful lava glides,\nThat through the shadows, distant, glares,\nAnd tinges every object round.\nThus, paying unto man no heed,\nOr to the ages that he calls antique,\nOr to the generations as they pass,\nNature forever young remains,\nOr at a pace so slow proceeds,\nShe stationary seems.\nEmpires, meanwhile, decline and fall,\nAnd nations pass away, and languages:\nShe sees it not, or _will_ not see;\nAnd yet man boasts of immortality!\nAnd thou, submissive flower,\nThat with thy fragrant foliage dost adorn\nThese desolated plains,\nThou, too, must fall before the cruel power\nOf subterranean fire,\nWhich, to its well-known haunts returning, will\nIts fatal border spread\nO'er thy soft leaves and branches fine.\nAnd thou wilt bow thy gentle head,\nWithout a struggle, yielding to thy fate:\nBut not with vain and abject cowardice,\nWilt thy destroyer supplicate;\nNor wilt, erect with senseless haughtiness,\nLook up unto the stars,\nOr o'er the wilderness,\nWhere, not from choice, but Fortune's will,\nThy birthplace thou, and home didst find;\nBut wiser, far, than man,\nAnd far less weak;\nFor thou didst ne'er, from Fate, or power of thine,\nImmortal life for thy frail children seek.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/The-Ginestra,"}

With what hopes feedest thou\nThy heart? Say in what thoughts, and in what deeds,\nAgreeable or sad, dost thou invest\nThe idleness thy ancestors bequeathed\nTo thee, a dull and heavy heritage?\nAll life, indeed, in every walk of life,\nIs idleness, if we may give that name\nTo every work achieved, or effort made,\nThat has no worthy aim in view, or fails\nThat aim to reach. And if you idle call\nThe busy crew, that daily we behold,\nFrom tranquil morn unto the dewy eve,\nBehind the plough, or tending plants and flocks,\nBecause they live simply to keep alive,\nAnd life is worthless for itself alone,\nThe honest truth you speak. His nights and days\nThe pilot spends in idleness; the toil\nAnd sweat in workshops are but idleness;\nThe soldier's vigils, perils of the field,\nThe eager merchant's cares are idle all;\nBecause true happiness, for which alone\nOur mortal nature longs and strives, no man,\nOr for himself, or others, e'er acquires\nThrough toil or sweat, through peril, or through care.\nYet for this fierce desire, which mortals still\nFrom the beginning of the world have felt,\nBut ever felt in vain, for happiness,\nBy way of soothing remedy devised,\nNature, in this unhappy life of ours,\nHad manifold necessities prepared,\nNot without thought or labor satisfied;\nSo that the days, though ever sad, less dull\nMight seem unto the human family;\nAnd this desire, bewildered and confused,\nMight have less power to agitate the heart.\nSo, too, the various families of brutes,\nWho have, no less than we, and vainly, too,\nDesire for happiness; but they, intent\nOn that which is essential to their life,\nConsume their days more pleasantly, by far,\nNor chide, with us, the dulness of the hours.\nBut _we_, who unto other hands commit\nThe furnishing of our immediate wants,\nHave a necessity more grave to meet,\nFor which no other ever can provide,\nWith ennui laden, and with suffering;\nThe stern necessity of killing time;\nThat cruel, obstinate necessity,\nFrom which, nor hoarded gold, nor wealth of flocks,\nNor fertile fields, nor sumptuous palaces,\nNor purple robes, the race of man can save.\nAnd if one, scorning such a barren life,\nAnd hating to behold the light of day,\nTurns not a homicidal hand upon\nHimself, anticipating sluggish Fate,\nFor the sharp sting of unappeased desire,\nThat vainly calls for happiness, he seeks,\nIn desperate chase, on every side, in vain,\nA thousand inefficient remedies,\nIn lieu of that, which Nature gives to all.\nOne to his dress devotes himself, and hair,\nHis gait and gesture and the learned lore\nOf horses, carriages, to crowded halls,\nTo thronged piazzas, and to gardens gay;\nAnother gives his nights and days to games,\nAnd feasts, and dances with the reigning belles:\nA smile perpetual is on his lips;\nBut in his breast, alas, stern and severe,\nLike adamantine column motionless,\nEternal ennui sits, against whose might\nAvail not vigorous youth, nor prattle fond\nThat falls from rosy lips, nor tender glance\nThat trembles in two dark and lustrous eyes;\nThe most bewildering of mortal things,\nMost precious gift of heaven unto man.\nAnother, as if hoping to escape\nSad destiny, in changing lands and climes\nHis days consuming, wandering o'er sea\nAnd hills, the whole earth traverses; each spot\nThat Nature, in her infinite domain,\nTo restless man hath made accessible,\nHe visits in his wanderings. Alas,\nBlack care is seated on the lofty prow;\nBeneath each clime, each sky, he asks in vain\nFor happiness; sadness still lives and reigns.\nAnother in the cruel deeds of war\nPrefers to pass his hours, and dips his hand,\nFor his diversion, in his brother's blood:\nAnother in his neighbor's misery\nHis comfort finds, and artfully contrives\nTo kill the time, in making others sad.\n_This_ man still walks in wisdom's ways, or art\nPursues; _that_ tramples on the people's rights,\nAt home, abroad; the ancient rest disturbs\nOf distant shores, on fraudful gain intent,\nWith cruel war, or sharp diplomacy;\nAnd so his destined part of life consumes.\nThee a more gentle wish, a care more sweet\nLeads and controls, still in the flower of youth,\nIn the fair April of thy days, to most\nA time so pleasant, heaven's choicest gift;\nBut heavy, bitter, wearisome to _him_\nWho has no country. Thee the love of song\nImpels, and of portraying in thy speech\nThe beauty, that so seldom in the world\nAppears and fades so soon, and _that_, more rare\nWhich fond imagination, kinder far\nThan Nature, or than heaven, so bounteously\nFor our entranced, deluded souls provides.\nOh, fortunate a thousand-fold is he,\nWho loses not his fancy's freshness as\nThe years roll by; whom envious Fate permits\nTo keep eternal sunshine in his heart,\nWho, in his ripe and his declining years,\nAs was his custom in his glorious youth,\nIn his deep thought enhances Nature's charms,\nGives life to death, and to the desert, bloom.\nMay heaven this fortune give to thee; and may\nThe spark that now so warms thy breast, make thee\nIn thy old age a votary of song!\n_I_ feel no more the sweet illusions of\nThat happy time; those charming images\nHave faded from my eyes, that I so loved,\nAnd which, unto my latest hour, will be\nRemembered still, with hopeless sighs and tears.\nAnd when this breast to all things has become\nInsensible and cold, nor the sweet smile\nAnd rest profound of lonely sun-lit plains,\nNor cheerful morning song of birds in spring,\nNor moonlight soft, that rests on hills and fields,\nBeneath the limpid sky, will move my heart;\nWhen every beauty, both of Nature, and\nOf Art, to me will be inanimate\nAnd mute; each tender feeling, lofty thought,\nUnknown and strange; my only comfort, then,\nPoor beggar, must I find in studies more\nSevere; to them, thenceforward, must devote\nThe wretched remnant of unhappy life:\nThe bitter truth must I investigate,\nThe destinies mysterious, alike\nOf mortal and immortal things;\nFor what was suffering humanity,\nBowed down beneath the weight of misery,\nCreated; to what final goal are Fate\nAnd Nature urging it; to whom can our\nGreat sorrow any pleasure, profit give;\nBeneath what laws and orders, to what end,\nThe mighty Universe revolves--the theme\nOf wise men's praise, to _me_ a mystery?\nI in these speculations will consume\nMy idleness; because the truth, when known,\nThough sad, has yet its charms. And if, at times,\nThe truth discussing, my opinions should\nUnwelcome be, or not be understood,\nI shall not grieve, indeed, because in me\nThe love of fame will be extinguished quite;\nOf fame, that idol frivolous and blind;\nMore blind by far than Fortune, or than Love.\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/To-Count-Carlo-Pepoli"}

{"title": "To The Moon", "author": "Count Giacomo Leopardi", "text": "O lovely moon, how well do I recall\nThe time,--'tis just a year--when up this hill\nI came, in my distress, to gaze at thee:\nAnd thou suspended wast o'er yonder grove,\nAs now thou art, which thou with light dost fill.\nBut stained with mist, and tremulous, appeared\nThy countenance to me, because my eyes\nWere filled with tears, that could not be suppressed;\nFor, oh, my life was wretched, wearisome,\nAnd _is_ so still, unchanged, belov\u00e8d moon!\nAnd yet this recollection pleases me,\nThis computation of my sorrow's age.\nHow pleasant is it, in the days of youth,\nWhen hope a long career before it hath,\nAnd memories are few, upon the past\nTo dwell, though sad, and though the sadness last!\n\u00a9 by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\nShow analysis", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8527571-To-The-Moon-by-Count-Giacomo-Leopardi"}
