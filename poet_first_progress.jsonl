The angels, guardians of the child's innocence, watch over her bedside. The mention of \"God's laughing in Heaven\" and the \"Sailing Seven\" symbolize divine protection and happiness. However, the mother expresses a bittersweet note, acknowledging that the child's growth and independence will bring both joy and the inevitable separation from her.Compared to Yeats's other works, this poem is devoid of his typical themes of Irish mythology and Irish nationalism. Instead, it focuses on the universal and timeless experience of a mother's love. It reflects the sentimentality and gentleness found in many lullabies, aligning with the Victorian era's emphasis on domesticity and family values.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (11)6Good postLovelyNicely pennedLike (11)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8453607-A-Cradle-Song-by-William-Butler-Yeats", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:32:47.185237"}

Cummings' unconventional style, with its lowercase letters and unconventional punctuation, creates a sense of fragmentation and disruption. This reflects the transience and fragility of life, as the leaf, once vibrant and full of life, now falls to the ground. The stark contrast between the blackness of the leaf and the whiteness of the sky emphasizes the poem's central theme of death and loss. Compared to Cummings' other works, this poem exhibits a similar focus on mortality and the passage of time. However, its brevity and simplicity give it a distinct intensity that makes it particularly memorable. In the context of its time period, the poem's themes of transience and loss resonate with the disillusionment and uncertainty that characterized post-World War I society.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (7)2GreatEnjoyed itInspiringLike (7)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8494093--blac-by-e.e.-cummings/", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:32:56.872737"}

The contrast between the vibrant \"april\" and the barren \"autumn\" emphasizes the bleakness of the winter landscape.The speaker's desire for \"terrible anonymity\" and the \"murdering minus of cold\" reflects a longing for escape from the pain of existence. The violent imagery of \"millionary knives of wind\" and \"scatter his nothing\" conveys the destructive force of nature and the vulnerability of the individual.The poem's unusual capitalization and punctuation create a sense of fragmentation and disorientation, reflecting the speaker's state of mind.

Mist expresses doubt about the sleepers' awareness of their surroundings and their place in the world. Smoke, on the other hand, insists on their resilience and the potential for enlightenment.The poem reflects Frost's preoccupation with isolation and the search for self-knowledge. Compared to his other works, it shares themes of uncertainty and human limitations. However, it also incorporates a philosophical dimension, exploring the nature of reality and the relationship between inner and outer worlds.The conversation between Mist and Smoke suggests a perpetual cycle of questioning and searching. The sleepers represent the human condition, striving for knowledge and an understanding of their existence. The poem's use of personification and imagery creates a dreamlike atmosphere, blurring the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical.Moreover, the poem comments on the limitations of conventional learning and the pursuit of external validation. Mist and Smoke suggest that true enlightenment comes from within, through introspection and a connection with nature.

The poem's protagonist embarks on a journey to rediscover a long-lost fountain, but his quest ultimately leads him to a profound encounter with the written word.Like many of Frost's other works, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is characterized by its vivid imagery and deceptively simple language. The poem's opening lines establish a sense of anticipation and wonder as the speaker learns of a mysterious mountain that holds promise of great fortune. However, as the journey progresses, the speaker's hopes are gradually dashed, and he is confronted with the harsh realities of time and change.The poem's central metaphor, the fountain, serves as a powerful symbol of the protagonist's longing for connection and meaning in life. Like the mythical Fountain of Youth, the fountain represents a desire to escape the limitations of time and find renewal. However, just as the protagonist's physical search for the fountain proves futile, so too does his search for spiritual fulfillment in the external world.Ultimately, it is through his encounter with the poetess Clara Robinson's books that the protagonist finds a sense of solace and purpose. The books become a metaphor for the power of literature to transcend the boundaries of time and provide a window into the human experience. Frost's portrayal of the poetess's \"shut in for life\" condition suggests the transformative power of art to liberate the spirit even in the face of physical limitations.In its exploration of disappointment, nostalgia, and the transformative power of literature, \"Fountain, a Bottle, a Donkey, and Some Books\" is a characteristically complex and moving poem by Robert Frost. Like many of his other works, it invites multiple readings and challenges the reader to confront the essential questions of life and meaning.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (1)1Enjoyed itEnjoyed itGreatLike (1)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326555-A-Fountain--a-Bottle--a-Donkey-s-Ears--and-Some-Books-by-Robert-Frost", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:33:18.546388"}

The woman's vulnerability and desperation are contrasted with Big Boy's dismissive and transactional approach to relationships.The poem's conversational style creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The unadorned language and simple vocabulary convey the characters' emotions and motivations directly, highlighting the stark reality of their situation.Compared to other works by Langston Hughes, this poem is less explicitly political or polemical. However, it still reflects his broader concerns about social justice and the plight of marginalized communities, particularly women.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (8)3Good workEnjoyableClever workLike (8)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495397-50-50-by-Langston-Hughes", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:33:27.838670"}

The mermaid's tail is curved beneath his arm, suggesting both her otherness and her desire. The fisherman's occupation as a \"fisher boy\" adds a touch of irony to the scene, as he has seemingly caught a half-fish, half-girl.The poem's language is simple and direct, yet it evokes a vivid image that lingers in the reader's mind. The use of concrete details, such as the \"curved\" tail and the \"half fish, half girl,\" creates a strong sense of visual and physical presence.Compared to Hughes' other works, this poem is unique in its surreal and fantastical imagery. While his other poems often explore themes of race, identity, and social justice, this poem seems to exist in a world of its own, where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur.In terms of the time period, the poem reflects the modernist fascination with the subconscious and the surreal. It also aligns with the Harlem Renaissance's celebration of black culture and identity, as the fisherman, a black man, is depicted as a hero who has captured a creature from the sea.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (3)1Good workFantastic!I enjoyedLike (3)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495379-Catch-by-Langston-Hughes", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:33:37.137972"}

Born of an interracial relationship, the speaker grapples with his mixed heritage and the social implications it carries.The poem contrasts the circumstances of the speaker's parents' deaths, highlighting the stark disparities in their lives. The white father dies in a comfortable home, while the black mother passes away in impoverished conditions. This juxtaposition emphasizes the systemic inequality faced by African Americans in the time period.The speaker's identity as neither fully white nor black leaves him in a state of uncertainty and alienation. The poem concludes with a haunting question about where the speaker will die, reflecting the challenges and complexities of navigating a racialized society.In comparison to Hughes' other works, \"Cross\" shares similar themes of racial identity and social justice. However, it differs in its focus on the personal experiences of the speaker rather than broader historical narratives. The poem's simple yet powerful language effectively portrays the speaker's emotional struggle and the enduring legacy of racism in American society.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (30)11I enjoyedNicely doneInspired meLike (30)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495535-Cross-by-Langston-Hughes", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:33:40.451197"}

The reader sees these concepts contrasted through the image of a \"Heavenly Clause\" offering a \"Crown of Life\" in exchange for unwavering faithfulness. However, the poem's speaker rejects this offer, suggesting that true loyalty is not conditional upon reward or recognition.This poem differs from Dickinson's other works in its direct and concise language. Unlike many of her other poems, which use intricate imagery and metaphorical language, this poem conveys its message through straightforward and clear diction. Additionally, the poem's brevity and lack of punctuation contribute to its impact, creating a sense of urgency and immediacy.The poem also reflects the changing social and cultural norms of the time period. During the Victorian era, which saw a rise in religious fervor and moral conservatism, the idea of unwavering loyalty and submission to authority was widely upheld.

The poem's simplicity and use of everyday language make it relatable to readers experiencing loss.

The juxtaposition of comfort and dying creates a sense of dissonance, highlighting the fragility of life and the inevitability of its end. The ticking clock and knocking wind provide temporary distractions from the \"Dying Room,\" but their persistent and impersonal nature underscore the relentless passage of time. The children's play further emphasizes the contrast between life and death, underscoring the tragedy of losing the speaker's companion while others continue to live. The final lines express a sense of injustice and despair at the arbitrary nature of death, which takes the speaker's loved one while sparing the innocent.Compared to Dickinson's other works, this poem is relatively concise and straightforward in its language, yet it captures the same haunting and introspective tone.

It lacks the complexity and experimentalism of some of Eliot's better-known poems, but it retains his characteristic attention to language and rhythm.In terms of the time period, the poem reflects the disillusionment and uncertainty that pervaded society in the aftermath of World War I. The speaker's sense of loss and regret aligns with the broader mood of the era.

The poem's fragmented imagery and obscure references create a sense of mystery and disorientation, contrasting with the seemingly mundane setting. The character's laughter is described in unusual terms, comparing it to a fetus and the hidden depths of the sea, suggesting a hidden or subconscious nature. Eliot also juxtaposes classical mythological figures (Fragilion, Priapus) with modern figures (Mrs. Phlaccus, Professor Channing-Cheetah), adding to the poem's enigmatic atmosphere.

The child's palace, with silver walls and golden roof, is hidden on the terrace, represented by the tulsi plant pot. The princess is inaccessible in her faraway castle, symbolizing the elusive nature of the child's dreams. The child possesses a magic wand that can awaken the princess and make jewels fall from her lips, hinting at the transformative power of imagination. The barber in the story, a reference to traditional Indian fairytales, is also found on the terrace, underscoring the intertwining of reality and fantasy.The poem's simple language and repeated whispers evoke the child's eagerness to share their secret while maintaining its exclusivity. Its whimsical imagery differs from the author's other works, which often explore more serious themes of love, loss, and social justice.

It departs from Gibran's earlier works by exhibiting a more measured and introspective tone, devoid of the fiery passion that characterized his previous writings.The poem's structure consists of a series of four encounters, separated by intervals of a thousand years, between the speaker and God. In each encounter, the speaker's perception of God transforms, from a passive, unquestioning servant to a questioning creator, a loving son, and eventually, an inseparable partner.This progression mirrors humanity's collective journey toward spiritual maturity, a gradual realization of the divine as both transcendent and immanent, both distant and intimate. The poem's sparse language and simple imagery belie its profound exploration of humanity's search for connection and meaning in the vast expanse of existence.In comparison to the prevailing literary trends of the time, the poem stands out for its deeply personal and introspective approach to spirituality. While other contemporary works often focused on external rituals and established doctrines, this poem delves into the individual's subjective experience of the divine, offering a more intimate and relatable portrayal of faith.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (11)3LovelyNice shareWell writtenLike (11)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8511759-God-by-Khalil-Gibran", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:49:55.001447"}

Unlike the author's other works that often exude a mystical and transcendent tone, this poem delves into the intricacies of human relationships and the challenges of navigating different perspectives.The speaker's enigmatic nature is conveyed through the metaphor of a \"care-woven garment,\" representing the superficial persona they present to the world. Their true self, the \"I\" within, remains hidden and inaccessible to others. This concealment is motivated by a desire to protect both themselves and their friend from potential conflicts and misunderstandings.The poem further emphasizes the disconnect between the speaker's internal thoughts and their outward actions. Their words are merely reflections of their friend's own beliefs, and their deeds are manifestations of their friend's hopes. This disparity creates a barrier that prevents genuine connection and understanding.Despite the gulf between their perspectives, the speaker maintains a facade of agreement, avoiding any direct confrontation that could expose their true nature. This act of self-preservation isolates them emotionally, leading them to desire solitude in their own subjective experiences.The poem's unique contribution lies in its exploration of the tension between the need for connection and the desire for self-preservation. By presenting a character who struggles to reconcile these competing impulses, Gibran highlights the complexities of human relationships and the challenges of navigating different perspectives.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (6)0I enjoyedLiked itWell writtenLike (6)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8511715-My-Friend-by-Khalil-Gibran", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:49:58.078791"}

It delves into the passionate and reckless nature of love, comparing it to the behavior of drunkards who lose control and indulge in chaos. The lover is portrayed as a sovereign above all others, unyielding in the face of mortality and detached from material possessions.Rumi's use of vivid imagery and symbolic language creates a distinct atmosphere that resonates with the reader. The imagery of the moon appearing as a drunkard dropping clothes in the street captures the unpredictable and intoxicating nature of love. The exhortation to \"break all the glasses\" and \"fall toward the glassblower\" suggests a radical rejection of societal norms and a surrender to the divine.Compared to Rumi's other works, this poem shares a common theme of spiritual transcendence through love. It also reflects his belief in the transformative power of surrendering to a higher force. However, it stands out in its use of earthy and relatable imagery, drawing parallels between the experience of love and the behavior of intoxicated individuals.In the context of its time period, this poem may have resonated with contemporary audiences who were seeking solace and meaning in a world marked by instability and change.

The speaker finds solace in birdsong, which fills them with joy but leaves them speechless. They yearn for a deeper expression, imploring the universal soul to inspire their own song of praise. The poem's simplicity belies its profound message, contrasting the ecstatic experience of the birds with the inexpressible nature of the divine.Compared to Rumi's other works, this poem is relatively concise and direct, lacking the extended metaphors and allegorical language that characterize his more elaborate writings. Yet, it captures the essence of Rumi's mysticism, expressing the paradoxical nature of spiritual longing: both ecstatic and silent, both yearning and fulfilled.The poem also reflects the cultural context of its time. In 13th-century Persia, where Rumi lived, music and poetry were central to religious expression. Birdsong, in particular, held symbolic significance, representing the yearnings of the soul for divine guidance.

Unlike the physical world, where joys fade with familiarity, Fancy offers limitless and perpetual delights.Keats' use of vivid imagery and sensory language brings the idyllic and ephemeral quality of nature to life. The poem's repetition of \"Let Fancy roam\" serves as a recurring refrain, reinforcing the importance of embracing imagination as a source of solace and beauty.Compared to Keats' other works, \"Fancy\" is less introspective and more focused on the external world. It exudes a sense of escapism and wonder, urging the reader to seek refuge in nature and the boundless realms of the imagination.Set in the Romantic era, \"Fancy\" reflects the period's preoccupation with the sublime and the interconnectedness of nature and the human experience.

The speaker, a forlorn knight, laments his affliction, marked by physical and emotional distress. The imagery of the barren landscape, with its withered sedge and absent birdsong, sets an eerie and desolate atmosphere.The knight's meeting with a beautiful but enigmatic lady in the meads seems to promise enchantment and love. However, her true nature is revealed as she leads him to her elfin grot, where he falls asleep and dreams of pale figures warning him of doom. The lady's love, once a source of solace, turns into a curse that has left the knight alone and desolate.The poem explores themes of love, loss, and the supernatural. It portrays the knight as a victim of a seductive but ultimately dangerous force. The language is sparse and direct, reflecting the knight's emotional state.

Through sensory descriptions and the personification of body parts, the speaker conveys the overwhelming power of physical attraction and the potential for both pleasure and pain it holds.The poem's focus on physicality and sensuality sets it apart from Keats' more Romantic works, which often explore themes of nature, beauty, and mortality. The poem's eroticism and frankness were considered somewhat daring for its time, reflecting the growing interest in individualism and personal expression during the Romantic era.The poem's use of imagery and language creates a vivid and sensual experience for the reader. The speaker's descriptions of the woman's body as \"unfelt, unheard, unseen\" and her \"languid arms in silver slumber lying\" evoke a sense of mystery and longing. The personification of her \"faery lids\" and \"lips\" suggests their alluring and potentially dangerous power.Overall, the poem is a powerful and evocative exploration of the physical and emotional complexities of love and desire.

It aligns with his transcendentalist philosophy, which emphasized the intuitive and spiritual connection to the natural world.For its time, this poem differs from the prevailing romanticism by eschewing sentimentalism and focusing on the transformative and intellectual aspects of wine.

Emerson's other works often delve into similar themes, such as the importance of intuition and the interconnectedness of all things. For its time, the poem's focus on the subjective experience of beauty was innovative, reflecting the growing emphasis on individual sentiment and emotion in Romanticism.Stylistically, the poem employs vivid imagery and alliteration to create a sense of movement and immediacy. The use of verbs like \"smote\" and \"flung\" suggests a dynamic pursuit of beauty, while the repetition of \"b\" sounds in lines 7-8 and \"c\" sounds in lines 11-12 creates a musicality that enhances the poem's emotional impact.However, the poem also conveys a sense of frustration and unattainability, as Seyd's tireless pursuit of beauty ultimately proves futile. The fleeting nature of beauty is emphasized by the use of words like \"slumbering\" and \"hovering,\" which suggest its ephemeral and elusive qualities.Despite its ultimate inaccessibility, beauty remains a transformative force for Seyd. It inspires him to see the world with wonder and to appreciate the inherent beauty in all things. The poem thus celebrates the power of beauty to elevate and inspire, even if it remains forever beyond our grasp.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (3)1Enjoyed it!EnjoyableInspired meLike (3)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8494685-Beauty-by-Ralph-Waldo-Emerson", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T15:51:03.228226"}

Like \"Walden,\" it emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature and following one's own path. However, the poem is more direct and less meditative than Thoreau's other writings.Within the context of the 19th century, \"Conscience\" reflects the growing disillusionment with the strict moral codes and religious dogma of the time.

The speaker's use of metaphors, such as love being a \"link\" between heaven and earth and a \"favorite retreat,\" captures the multifaceted and ethereal nature of the emotion.The poem's exploration of love's paradoxical qualities is akin to other Romantic works of the time, which often delved into the interplay between reason and emotion.

The wind becomes a symbol of grief, while the woods and caves weep in sympathy. The repetitive use of \"Wail\" emphasizes the overwhelming sorrow that permeates the natural world.Compared to Shelley's other works, \"A Dirge\" is relatively short and less abstract. It shares themes of nature and human suffering with \"Ode to the West Wind\" and \"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,\" but its tone is more somber and less hopeful.\"A Dirge\" reflects the Romantic era's preoccupation with emotional expression and the power of nature. Its melancholic tone and evocative imagery capture the despair and turmoil of the period, a time marked by both political upheaval and industrialization.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (12)4Thank youFantasticInspiringLike (12)Tip:  The rhythm of your lines and spaces is _Learn commenting", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8499633-A-Dirge-by-Percy-Bysshe-Shelley", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T16:06:40.454215"}

Yet it also seems more personal and introspective than many Romantic poems. The speaker is deeply affected by the passage of time and the loss of former joys, which he expresses through a series of rhetorical questions and exclamations that create a sense of urgency and despair.

The setting is a squalid trailer, where George, the protagonist, is living a life of poverty and self-neglect. The arrival of Constance, who has left her abusive husband and stolen his money, brings a sense of excitement and chaos into George's life.The poem is notable for its stark and realistic portrayal of life at the margins of society. Bukowski's language is blunt and unadorned, reflecting the characters' own rough existence. The dialogue between George and Constance is full of profanity and sexual innuendo, capturing the raw and impulsive nature of their relationship.The poem also explores themes of masculinity, power, and desire. George's initial passivity and self-hatred give way to a sense of lust and control when he sees Constance's legs. Constance, on the other hand, is both vulnerable and defiant, expressing both her desire for George's physicality and her frustration with the constraints placed on women in society.Compared to Bukowski's other works, \"A Man\" is relatively short and straightforward. However, it shares many of the same themes and stylistic elements as his other poems, including the exploration of social outcasts, the rejection of societal norms, and the celebration of the raw and uncompromising aspects of human nature.In the context of its time period, the poem reflects the growing social unrest and disillusionment of the 1960s and 1970s. Bukowski's gritty and anti-establishment writing style resonated with countercultural movements of the time, which rejected traditional values and embraced a more authentic and rebellious way of life.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (13)5Great postWell writtenFantasticLike (13)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509497-A-Man-by-Charles-Bukowski", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T16:21:52.882591"}

It suggests that true creation stems from an inner drive that transcends external obstacles and material possessions.The poem's brevity and straightforward language underscore its central message: that neither ideal surroundings nor freedom from obligations can guarantee artistic output. Instead, the speaker asserts that creativity persists amidst adversity, disability, and chaos.Bukowski's perspective aligns with his other works, which often explore themes of alienation and the struggle for authenticity in a superficial world. It also reflects the social and economic realities of his time, where many aspiring artists faced financial and logistical challenges. By challenging the notion that external factors determine artistic success, the poem encourages a deeper understanding of the complexities of the creative process.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (38)5InspiredGood workGood postLike (38)Tip:  Does it create a picture in your mind?Learn commenting", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326888-air-and-light-and-time-and-space-by-Charles-Bukowski", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T16:21:55.977673"}

The poem also reveals the speaker's fear of being a burden and his desire for reconciliation.Compared to Bukowski's other works, this poem is less characterized by vulgarity and more focused on intimacy and vulnerability. It reflects the poet's preoccupation with themes of mortality, love, and loss, common in his later period.

The speaker describes the absence of the beloved as a visceral experience that leaves them feeling wounded and incomplete.The poem's imagery is both evocative and carnal, with references to \"crystalline\" tears, \"trembling\" limbs, and the \"gift of life\" shared through lovemaking. The speaker's hunger and thirst for the beloved is expressed through the metaphor of biting, suggesting a primal and consuming desire.This poem departs from Neruda's earlier works, which often celebrated love's transformative power in a more abstract and idealized way. Here, the emphasis is on the physical and emotional intensity of the bond, with all its complexities and contradictions.The poem also reflects the turmoil and uncertainty of the time period in which it was written. Neruda was a vocal supporter of the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, and the poem's themes of absence and longing may be seen as a reflection of the widespread suffering and displacement caused by the conflict.(hide)Read more \u2192Like (17)5Great jobGood workGreatLike (17)", "source_url": "https://allpoetry.com/poem/8496961-Absence-by-Pablo-Neruda", "scraped_at": "2025-09-27T16:37:30.552743"}
